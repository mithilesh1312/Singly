Foursquare API Platform and Data Use Policy

   Users of the Foursquare Labs, Inc. ("Foursquare") application
   programming interface ("API") and Foursquare Data (as defined below)
   are required to comply with Foursquare's [17]Developer Policies,
   [18]Acceptable Use Policy, [19]API License Agreement and the terms and
   conditions of this Policy.

I. General

     * Your use of the API and Foursquare Data, including the collection,
       use, maintenance and disclosure of user data shall comply with all
       applicable laws, rules and regulations and the terms of this
       Policy, and any advertising, marketing, privacy, or other
       self-regulatory code(s) applicable to your industry.
     * You must not take any action that constitutes unauthorized or
       unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk e-mail.

II. Authorization

     * You must take commercially reasonable steps, compliant with
       applicable laws, rules and regulations, to protect all data you
       collect, obtain or access through the API or that users submit to
       the Foursquare service through your application and/or website
       ("Foursquare Data") and your authentication key from unauthorized
       use, disclosure or access.
     * You must not give your authentication key to another party and you
       take responsibility for any and all use of the API using your
       authentication key.
     * Foursquare may revoke your authentication credentials at any time,
       for any reason or no reason, with or without notice, and without
       liability to you or any other person.
     * You must notify us immediately in the event of any unauthorized
       access to Foursquare Data, your authentication key, and/or your
       application and/or website.
     * If your application and/or website authenticates Foursquare service
       users:
          + You must not include functionality in your application and/or
            website that requests or collects Foursquare username or
            passwords, and you may only permit users to log in via OAuth2.
          + Your application and/or website must provide a link to the
            Foursquare service settings page where the user can disconnect
            your application and/or website from the Foursquare service.

III. Access/Use

     * You will only request the Foursquare Data you need to operate your
       application and/or website and must make no further use of it and
       delete it when your application and/or website has no such further
       use for it, including, without limitation, when a user has
       withdrawn consent.
     * Foursquare expressly reserves the right to limit the number and/or
       frequency of API requests in its sole discretion. If Foursquare
       reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent
       the rate limits (including, without limitation, through
       mass-registering of applications), your ability to use the API may
       be temporarily or permanently blocked, with or without notice, and
       without Foursquare liability to you or any other person.
     * If your application and/or website requires or permits the transfer
       of user information outside of the user's home country (including
       transfers to Foursquare's servers, which are in the U.S.), you must
       ensure that such transfer complies with applicable laws.
     * If your application and/or website collects, obtains or accesses
       any information about Foursquare service users or submits any user
       information to Foursquare, whether acting as a user of your
       application and/or website or indirectly:
          + You must prominently notify and obtain affirmative consent
            from the user before his or her location data is collected or
            used by your application and/or website. The notification must
            clearly disclose that both you and Foursquare collect and use
            the user's location data;
          + You must respect a user's Foursquare user settings.
          + You must obtain affirmative consent from the user who provided
            the data before using it for any purpose other than displaying
            it back to that user on your application and/or website.
          + You must obtain affirmative consent from a user before you
            post any information on their behalf on your application
            and/or website, the Foursquare service or through any third
            party service (including but not limited to Twitter or
            Facebook).
          + If a user authorizes your application and/or website to access
            the Foursquare service, you may use such user's Foursquare
            service friends' data only in the context of the user's
            experience with your application and/or website. You may not
            use a user's friends' information outside of your application
            and/or website, even if a user consents to such use. No other
            use or retention of friend information is permitted.
          + Your application and/or website may not falsify the location
            of a user when communicating with Foursquare.
          + You may not publicly display any personal information of a
            user (e.g., name or profile photos) in any advertisement or
            promotions without Foursquare's prior written consent.
     * If you receive any de-identified Foursquare Data, you will not use
       the Foursquare Data in combination with any other content,
       documentation, code, data and related materials made available
       through any other Foursquare product, service or application
       programming interface, or any product, service or application of
       any third party, to deanonymize, or attempt to deanonymize by any
       manner or means, any Foursquare Data or to otherwise identify any
       individual.
     * If you use any Foursquare location information, you must comply
       with our location database platform[20]usage rules.
     * If your application is using the Foursquare API to build an
       integration that is similar to the essential user experience of
       Foursquare by providing services around local discovery, search, or
       recommendations, you may be subject to additional terms.
     * If you use any "Explore" Foursquare Data you will not co-mingle any
       ranking and/or signal information obtained from such Foursquare
       Data with your own or third party ranking and/or signal
       information.
     * Access to the API is currently provided for free, but Foursquare
       reserves the right to charge for access to the API in the future,
       at its sole discretion. If we do charge a fee for using the API or
       any feature thereof, you do not have any obligation to continue to
       use the API or the applicable feature.

IV. Retention

     * Your application and/or website must offer a simple means for users
       to disable your application and/or website, upon which disabling,
       you shall permanently delete all data of such user.
     * You may cache data you receive through use of the API in order to
       improve your application's and/or website's user experience, but
       you should try to keep the data up to date and must delete all old
       data. This permission does not give you any rights to cached data.
       For clarity, and without limitation,
          + You may not cache or store any Foursquare places information
            (including tips and venue photos) for more than 30 days
            without refreshing.
          + You may not cache a user's raw check-in information for more
            than 24 hours without refreshing.
          + You may not cache any data for any person that has not
            authorized your application and/or website (e.g., friends of
            users of your application) for more than 3 hours.
          + You may not track a user's check-in history or retain any data
            derived from a user's check-in history without first making
            the desired use clear to the user and obtaining affirmative
            consent to that use from that user. This includes tracking
            users via "here now" or top visitors of a venue.
          + In no event may you cache any data for more than 30 days.
     * If you stop using the API or we disable your application and/or
       website, you must delete all Foursquare Data.
     * You must delete all data concerning a user that you receive from
       the API if the user asks you to do so, and you must provide a
       simple and easily accessible mechanism for users to make such a
       request. We may require you to delete data you receive from the API
       if you violate our terms. In the event that we do, we will have no
       liability to you or any other person.
     * Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Foursquare (a) ceases
       to provide the API or its places database through the API or (b)
       elects to charge for access to the API or its places database, and
       you elect not to continue to use the API and/or Foursquare's places
       database because of such charges and you notify Foursquare in
       writing of the same (each a "Transition Event"), Foursquare hereby
       allows you to retain the Transition Venue Information (as defined
       below) for a period of 3 months after the Transition Event
       ("Transition Period") while you transition your service and/or
       website to a different places database. If at any time during the
       Transition Period you transition to a new places database, the
       license from Foursquare automatically terminates and you must
       delete any such Transition Venue Information within 30 days after
       such transition, provided that you may continue to use any
       Foursquare venue ids. For the purposes of this Policy, "Transition
       Venue Information" means the address, phone number, email address,
       lat/lng information, url and twitter handle associated with any
       venue that is included in Foursquare's places database that you
       accessed prior to the Transition Event.

V. No Transfer

     * You will not directly or indirectly transfer any Foursquare Data,
       including user data or Foursquare user IDs, to (or use such data in
       connection with) any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other
       advertising or monetization related toolset, even if a user
       consents to such transfer or use. By "indirectly," we mean you
       cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then
       transfers the data to an ad network. By "any Foursquare Data," we
       mean all data obtained through use of the API, including aggregate,
       anonymous or derivative data.
     * You will not sell, rent, or transfer any Foursquare Data. If you
       are acquired by or merge with a third party, you may continue to
       use user data within your application and/or website, but you may
       not transfer data outside your application and/or website.

VI. Privacy Policy

     * If you collect, use, store or disclose any Foursquare Data:
          + You must provide a privacy policy to users of your application
            and/or website that clearly discloses how you collect, use,
            store and disclose user data, including that:
               o you receive and use Foursquare service user data,
                 including a description of the categories of user data
                 received and how you use and disclose it;
               o you share user data with Foursquare, for use by
                 Foursquare for its own purposes; and
               o the user may read the [21]Foursquare privacy policy
          + You must clearly and conspicuously present your privacy policy
            to each user at the point of application and/or download,
            installation, authorization or first-run, and you must also
            make the policy available from the application user interface
            or from the home page of your website.
          + Your application and/or website must not collect personally
            identifiable information of any user unless it first informs
            the user about the types of information being collected and
            how that information may be used and then obtains the user's
            express permission for those uses.

VII. Attribution/Trademarks

     * In connection with your use of the API and Foursquare Data you must
       comply with our [22]Attribution and Linking Policy. Additionally,
       you are required to display all attribution information and any
       proprietary notices associated with the Foursquare Data that you
       collect, obtain or access through the API, including without
       limitation data from third party data providers.
     * Your application and/or website must not:
          + Use business names and/or logos in a manner that can mislead,
            confuse or deceive users (e.g., do not copy the look and feel
            of the Foursquare service);
          + Confuse or mislead users about the source or purpose of your
            application and/or website;
          + Impersonate or facilitate impersonation of others in a manner
            that can mislead, confuse or deceive users.
     * You must not express or imply any affiliation or relationship with
       or endorsement by us.
     * If your application and/or website displays any Foursquare logos or
       trademarks, you must prominently include the following statement:
       "All of the Foursquare^® logos (including all badges) and
       trademarks displayed on this [application/service] are the property
       of Foursquare Labs, Inc."
     * You must read and comply with the [23]Foursquare Trademark and
       Brand Feature Guidelines.

VIII. Permissions/Feedback

     * By incorporating the API into your website or service, you agree
       that Foursquare may collect and use information from you and your
       users as described in our Privacy Policy. You also agree that
       Foursquare may use automated methods to analyze your website or
       service where the API and/or Foursquare Materials have been
       incorporated. Any information you or your users submit, upload,
       post, create, or add to the Foursquare services through your use of
       the API (including, without limitation, the use by users of your
       service and/or website) shall be deemed a User Submission (as
       defined in the Terms of Use).
     * Foursquare shall have the right to use, reproduce, transfer,
       sublicense and otherwise exploit perpetually any place, venue,
       latitude and longitude, or other location information that you or
       your users submit, upload, post, create or add to the Foursquare
       services through your use of the API (including, without
       limitation, the use by users of your application and/or website).
     * If you choose to submit comments, ideas or feedback, you agree that
       Foursquare is free to use them without any restriction or
       compensation to you. By accepting your submission, Foursquare
       doesn't waive any rights to use similar or related feedback
       previously known to Foursquare, or developed by its employees, or
       obtained from sources other than you.

IX. Additional Terms for "Merchant API" Users

     * You agree to comply with the [24]Foursquare Venue and Event
       Platform Terms of Use.
     * When using the Merchant API to create, modify, view or display
       specials, offers, coupons, deals, etc. (collectively, "Specials")
       you must 1) expose the foursquare Special type, 2) provide
       attribution to Foursquare and 3) include a link to the relevant
       section of the foursquare venue dashboard.
     * A Special must:
          + Be a special, offer, coupon, that provides a good, service, or
            benefit offered to a user for free or for a reduced price.
          + Not require that a user use another service or website to
            redeem the Special.
          + Be tied to at least one "check-in" in order for the Special to
            be unlocked.
     * Your application and/or website must expose at least as much
       functionality with respect to the Foursquare Merchant Data as is
       made available through the Merchant API. If the Merchant API
       includes a particular function with respect to the Foursquare
       Merchant Data, all aspects of that function and all Merchant API
       calls related to that function must be enabled and exposed. Your
       application and/or website will need to expose any additional
       functionality added to the Merchant API within 4 months after you
       receive notice of any such functionality.
     * You acknowledge that Foursquare may monitor any Merchant API
       activity for the purpose of ensuring quality, improving Foursquare
       products and services and compliance with this Policy. You shall
       not try to interfere with such monitoring or otherwise obscure from
       Foursquare your Merchant API activity. Foursquare may use any
       technical means to overcome such interference.
     * You agree that Foursquare may inspect your application and/or
       website to determine your compliance with this Policy. Any such
       inspection will be during normal business hours. You must allow
       Foursquare to visit your place of business, or inspect your
       application and/or website in some other manner agreed between you
       and Foursquare, within 7 days after notice from Foursquare that
       Foursquare desires to inspect your applications and/or websites.
     * If you manage a venue(s) on behalf of your customers:
          + You will only manage venues of a customer that:
          + Has entered into a binding agreement with you in which the
            customer explicitly consents to your management of its
            venue(s);
          + Is associated with a Foursquare service user account that is
            tied to the manager relationship of the applicable verified
            venue(s) on the Foursquare services;
          + Is the direct manager of the applicable verified venue(s) on
            the Foursquare services.
     * Foursquare will have the right to have a listing of all of your
       customers and the venues that you manage;
     * You will not include functionality that requests or collects
       Foursquare service usernames or passwords of the customer.
     * You may only access venue data, including "here now" data, for
       venues you manage, or if you manage venues on behalf of your
       customers, only for venues that your customers manage.
     * You may only create, modify, view or display Specials on behalf of
       venues you manage, or if you manage venues on behalf of your
       customers, only on behalf of venues that your customers manage.
       Foursquare reserves the right to (i) remove, suspend, block, edit
       or modify any Specials in its sole discretion, without notice to
       you and for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt
       of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating
       to such Specials or if Foursquare is concerned that you may have
       violated this policy), or for no reason at all and (ii) to
       determine how and where to display the Specials in its sole
       discretion.
     * You must, at all times, provide to any customer for whose accounts
       you are accessing through the Merchant API the ability to easily
       and quickly (no longer than 3 business days after customer notice
       to you) disassociate their venues from your services and regain
       exclusive control of their venue accounts.

     You shall not use any automated means (for example scraping or
   robots) other than the Merchant API to access, query or otherwise
   collect Foursquare-related information Foursquare or any website owned
   or operated by Foursquare or a Foursquare partner site that displays
   Foursquare information.

     You shall not co-mingle any Foursquare Data with any data of a third
   party, specifically:
     * Your application and/or website must not show any input fields for
       collecting or transmitting Foursquare Data in the same tab or
       screen with the content of third parties or input fields for
       collecting or transmitting data to third parties.
     * Your application and/or website may not offer a functionality that
       copies data from one tab or screen into another tab or screen.

     Notwithstanding anything in Section IV (Retention) above:
     * In no event may you cache any Foursquare Data for more than 30
       days.
     * In no event may you cache any Foursquare Data that includes user
       data for more than 3 hours.
