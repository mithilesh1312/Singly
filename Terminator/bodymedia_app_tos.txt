   BODYMEDIA, INC. ("BodyMedia") API TERMS OF USE ("Terms of Use")

   These Terms of Use set forth the terms of access to and use of the
   application programming interface made available by BodyMedia ("API"),
   and the data transmitted from BodyMedia through the API ("Content").
   These Terms of Use also incorporate by reference the terms and
   conditions of BodyMedia's [2]Display, Branding and Attribution
   Policy, [3]Data Use Policy, and the [4]BodyMedia Website Terms and
   Conditions, (and any amendments thereto) (collectively, "API
   Agreement"):

   By accessing or using the API or Content, you agree to be bound by the
   API Agreement. If you access or use the API or Content on behalf of an
   entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity and
   its affiliates to the API Agreement in which case “you” or “your” shall
   refer to such entity. If you do not have authority, or if you do not
   agree with the terms of the API Agreement, you may not access or use
   the API or Content. You should read and print a copy of the documents
   included in the API Agreement for your records. In the event there is a
   conflict between such documents, these Terms of Use shall govern.
   BodyMedia reserves the right to modify or revise the API Agreement at
   any time. You should visit BodyMedia's website periodically to review
   the documents comprising the API Agreement and check for updates. Your
   continued use of the API or the Content after the effective date of any
   such changes will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to such
   changes. BodyMedia may, in its sole discretion, release subsequent
   versions of the API and require you to obtain and use the most current
   version.

   1. Purpose. The API is made available by BodyMedia to enable
   BodyMedia's partners and approved licensees to create applications that
   interface with the BodyMedia Fit websites by posting data and/or
   utilizing Content on a non-commercial non-distribution basis, unless
   commercial terms are separately agreed upon in writing by you and
   BodyMedia ("Purpose").

   2. Registration. In order to access or use the API, you must first
   register for and receive a valid BodyMedia license key ("License Key").
   There are two types of License Keys. One is designed to be used
   primarily for mobile devices and external or distributed applications
   ("Mobile and External App Key"), and one is to be used strictly by
   commercial partners of BodyMedia to access the API via their own site
   or portal strictly for server to server communication ("Member Service
   Partner Key"). You hereby agree not to use the Member Service Partner
   Key in any mobile devices or external or distributed applications or
   for anything other than server to server communication. You are only
   allowed to register for and use one License Key, unless otherwise
   permitted by BodyMedia in writing. All web services requests coming
   from such application or service shall reference your valid License
   Key. You agree to keep your License Key confidential and not share it
   with any third party, and you shall not permit any end-user, customer
   or third party to distribute any License Key provided by or on behalf
   of BodyMedia. BodyMedia shall have the right to audit your use of the
   License Keys and to disable and/or modify any License Key being
   utilized in violation of these Terms of Use.

   3. License. Subject to the terms set forth in the [5]Display, Branding
   and Attribution Policy and elsewhere in the API Agreement, BodyMedia
   hereby grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-sub-licensable,
   non-transferable license to (i) access and use the API to post data
   and/or receive the Content; (ii) display the Content via your
   application; and (iii) reproduce and display the BodyMedia name and
   logo ("Marks") solely in connection with the Purpose. You may not use
   the API, Content, or Marks for any other purpose without BodyMedia's
   prior written consent. These license rights are further limited by the
   restrictions set forth elsewhere in the API Agreement, and all rights
   not expressly granted to you hereunder are reserved by BodyMedia. If
   you desire to use the API for commercial purposes, please contact
   BodyMedia for further discussion.

   (a)              In addition to and without limiting any rights set
   forth in the Terms and Conditions, You agree that we are free to use
   any information or content submitted by you to BodyMedia (“Data Posts”)
   and that such Data Posts are subject to these Terms of Use.  You grant
   to BodyMedia all rights to use and incorporate such Data Posts in any
   BodyMedia product or service without notice, compensation or
   acknowledgement to you, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not
   limited to modifying the BodyMedia sites, and developing and marketing
   products and services.

   4.  Restrictions. You represent and warrant that you have secured all
   necessary rights from any third party with respect to the activities
   contemplated herein, including, without limitation, any participation
   in third party authorized developer programs for third party platforms
   or devices. You shall not use the API or the Content in any way in
   connection with any product or service that competes with BodyMedia.
   Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, you may not, nor may you
   assist or enable others to (i) sell, sublicense, rent, lease or lend
   any rights granted to it pursuant to these Terms of Use; (ii) alter,
   modify, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, decompile, or
   disassemble the API or the Content; (iii) decrypt or attempt to decrypt
   any data obtained from or using the API; (iv) use the API to, or design
   or develop software to, upload or otherwise transmit any material
   containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other computer
   code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the
   functionality of any software or hardware; (v) modify the Content,
   bulk-download, resell or distribute the Content; (vi) create or
   disclose metrics (general or otherwise) about, or perform any
   statistical analysis of, the Content; (vii) use the API or Content on
   behalf of any third party; (viii) display the Marks or Content in a
   manner that could reasonably imply an endorsement, relationship or
   affiliation with or sponsorship between you or a third party and
   BodyMedia, other than your permitted use of the API under the terms of
   the API Agreement; (ix) do anything that adversely impacts BodyMedia's
   servers or impacts the behavior of other applications using the API;
   (x) display the Content on any site that disparages BodyMedia or its
   products or services, or infringes any BodyMedia intellectual property
   or other rights; (xi) make marketing claims without BodyMedia's prior
   written approval; or (xii) use the API or Content in any manner or for
   any purpose that may violate any law or regulation, or any right of any
   person including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights
   and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, or which otherwise may be
   harmful to BodyMedia, its providers, its suppliers, end users, or your
   end users, or cause a violation by BodyMedia of the terms and
   conditions of its Privacy Policy.; the other provisions of this Terms
   of Use shall not limit the generality of this requirement.

   5.  Proprietary Rights and Confidentiality. The API, Content, Marks,
   and all intellectual property rights contained in the foregoing, any
   modifications to the foregoing (whether created by BodyMedia or you),
   and the data obtained by you from using the API, are and will at all
   times remain the sole and exclusive property of BodyMedia and its
   licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws
   and treaties (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and
   wherever in the world those rights may exist.). You agree that at no
   time during or after the termination of the API Agreement will you
   attempt to register any trademarks (including domain names) that are
   confusingly similar in any way to those of the Marks. The API and
   Content are licensed, not sold, and BodyMedia reserves all rights not
   expressly granted to you hereunder. You may not represent that any
   applications created in connection with the API are certified or
   otherwise endorsed by BodyMedia. You shall maintain in strict
   confidence all non-public information of BodyMedia disclosed in
   connection with the API Agreement, including, without limitation, any
   and all know-how, trade secrets, algorithms, technical information and
   business information (the "Confidential Information"), and shall only
   use such Confidential Information in connection with the Purpose.

   6. Termination. BodyMedia reserves the right, in its sole discretion
   (for any reason or for no reason) and at any time without notice to
   you, to change, suspend or discontinue the API and/or suspend or
   terminate your rights under the API Agreement to access, use and/or
   display (as applicable) the API, Marks and/or any Content. Any
   termination of the API Agreement will also immediately terminate the
   licenses granted to you hereunder. Such change, suspension or
   termination of the API may cause your existing services using the API
   to stop functioning properly. Upon any termination of the API
   Agreement, you will promptly delete and remove all calls to the API
   from all web pages, scripts, applications, and other software in your
   possession or under your control; promptly destroy and remove from all
   computers, hard drives, networks and other storage media all copies of
   the API, Marks and/or any Content; and you will promptly certify in
   writing to BodyMedia that such actions have been taken.

   7. Indemnity. You agree that your use of the API is at your own risk
   and you agree to hold harmless, defend (subject to BodyMedia's right to
   participate with counsel it selects) and indemnify BodyMedia and its
   subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees and suppliers
   from and against any and all claims damages, liabilities, costs and
   fees (including reasonable attorneys' fee) due to or arising from,
   directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, or in any way related to
   your application or your or your end users' use or implementation of
   the API or any Content, including, without limitation, use of the
   License Keys not in accordance with the restrictions set forth in these
   Terms of Use and/or any commercial agreement entered into with
   BodyMedia in connection with the use of a License Key. You will not
   agree to any settlement that imposes any obligation on BodyMedia
   without BodyMedia's prior consent.

   8. No Warranty. THE API, MARKS AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", "WITH
   ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY, OF ANY KIND AND AT
   YOUR SOLE RISK. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN, BODYMEDIA
   DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, AND DUTIES,
   WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE API, MARKS AND ANY
   CONTENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES
   OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, RESULTS OF USE, RELIABILITY, FITNESS FOR
   A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FURTHER, BODYMEDIA HEREBY
   DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT YOUR USE OF THE API WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED,
   SECURE, TIMELY OR ERROR FREE. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, YOU
   ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE API AGREEMENT DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO
   ANY SUPPORT FOR THE API.

   9. Limitation of Liability. YOU AGREE THAT BODYMEDIA SHALL HAVE NO
   LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR BASED ON YOUR USE OF THE API OR THE CONTENT,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ADVICE AND/OR FEEDBACK BASED ON THE
   CONTENT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN FAILS OF ITS
   ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT SHALL BODYMEDIA OR ITS
   SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS BE
   LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER ANY TORT, CONTRACT,
   NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY
   LOST PROFITS, LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
   INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
   TO USE THE API, EVEN IF BODYMEDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES ARE
   FORESEEABLE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, BODYMEDIA'S MAXIMUM
   LIABILITY UNDER THE API AGREEMENT SHALL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE
   PRICE PAID BY YOU TO BODYMEDIA HEREUNDER.

   10. Limited Relationship. BodyMedia and you are, and will remain,
   independent contractors, and nothing in the API Agreement will be
   construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, partnership or
   joint venture.

   11. No Endorsement. You understand and agree that BodyMedia does not
   endorse your application.

   12.  Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement will impair
   BodyMedia’s right to develop, acquire, license, promote, market, or
   distribute products, applications or technologies that perform the same
   or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, your application or
   any other products or technologies that you may develop, produce,
   market, or distribute.

   13. Miscellaneous. The API Agreement encompasses the entire agreement
   between you and BodyMedia regarding the subject matter discussed
   therein. The API Agreement, and any disputes arising from or relating
   to the interpretation thereof, will be governed by and construed under
   the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its
   conflicts of law provisions. You agree to personal jurisdiction by and
   venue in the state and federal courts of the Allegheny County,
   Pennsylvania. The failure of BodyMedia to exercise or enforce any right
   or provision of the API Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such
   right or provision. If any provision of the API Agreement is found to
   be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be replaced with terms
   that most closely match the intent of the provision that is not
   enforceable to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining API
   Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect. The API
   Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable, in whole or
   in part without BodyMedia's prior written consent. BodyMedia may assign
   the API Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time with or without
   notice to you.

   14. Survival. Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12,13 and 14 will survive
   any expiration or termination of this API Agreement for any reason.
