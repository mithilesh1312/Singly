General API Information

Schema

   All API access is over HTTP and starts with
http://github.com/api/v2/:format

   where :format is one of 'json', 'xml' or 'yaml', specifying what the
   response data should be formatted in. For all of the rest of this
   documentation, we will be leaving off that part, since it is the same
   for every API call.

   Note: XML and YAML support is currently deprecated. Existing API calls
   will continue to support it, but new API features will only support
   JSON.

Authentication

   [5]OAuth is the preferred authentication method because tokens can be
   limited to specific types of data, and can be revoked by users at any
   time.

   You can use HTTP Basic Auth to authenticate as a GitHub user. If you
   want to pass your API token instead, add "/token" to the Basic Auth
   username. Note that all requests that need authentication should
   include the Authentication header. Unauthenticated requests will return
   404 to prevent any sort of private information leakage.

   You may also pass login and token to any URL. Note that this method of
   authentication is deprecated.

   Several of the calls will return extra data if you are authenticated as
   a user that owns the repository or has access to it as a collaborator.
   For example, a call to get information on one of your private
   repositories would be:
$ curl -u "schacon:PASSWORD" \
  http://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show/schacon | jsonpretty
{
  "user": {
    "company": "GitHub",
    "name": "Scott Chacon",
    "following_count": 11,
    "blog": "http:\/\/scottchacon.com",
    "public_repo_count": 52,
    "public_gist_count": 45,
    "disk_usage": 294392,
    "collaborators": 3,
    "plan": {
      "name": "small",
      "collaborators": 5,
      "space": 1228800,
      "private_repos": 10
    },
    "id": 70,
    "owned_private_repo_count": 10,
    "total_private_repo_count": 14,
    "private_gist_count": 11,
    "login": "schacon",
    "followers_count": 182,
    "created_at": "2008\/01\/27 09:19:28 -0800",
    "email": "schacon@gmail.com",
    "location": "Redwood City, CA"
  }
}

   Here's a Basic Auth example using the API Token:
$ curl -u "schacon/token:6ef8395fecf207165f1a82178ae1b984" \
  http://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show/schacon | jsonpretty
{
  "user": {...

Secure Access

   You can access any API call over HTTPS, though public data can also be
   accessed over HTTP.

JSON callbacks

   If you send a 'callback' variable to any call, it will wrap the result
   JSON in that function, so you can automatically execute it.
$ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/issues/list/schacon/simplegit/open?callback
=myJsFunction
myJsFunction({"issues": [
{"user": "schacon",
"updated_at": "2009/04/17 16:19:02 -0700",
"body": "something",
"title": "new",
"number": 2,
"votes": 0,
"position": 1.0,
"created_at": "2009/04/17 16:18:50 -0700",
"state": "open"}
]});

Limitations

   Currently we are limiting API calls to 60 per minute. This may change
   in the future, or possibly per user at some point, but if you try to
   access the API more than 60 times in a minute, it will start giving you
   "access denied" errors.
