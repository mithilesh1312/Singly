Policies

I. Features and Functionality

    1. You must not violate any law or the rights of any individual or
       entity, and must not expose Facebook or Facebook users to harm or
       legal liability as determined by us in our sole discretion. In
       particular you will (if applicable): comply with the Video Privacy
       Protection Act (VPPA), and obtain any opt-in consent necessary from
       users so that user data subject to the VPPA may be shared on
       Facebook. You represent that any disclosure to us will not be
       incidental to the ordinary course of your business.
    2. You must not include functionality that proxies, requests or
       collects Facebook usernames or passwords.
    3. You must not circumvent (or claim to circumvent) our intended
       limitations on core Facebook features and functionality.
    4. If you offer a service for a user that integrates user data into a
       physical product (such as a scrapbook or calendar), you must only
       create a physical product for that user's personal and
       non-commercial use.
    5. If you exceed, or plan to exceed, any of the following thresholds
       please contact us by creating a [16]confidential bug report with
       the "threshold policy" tag as you may be subject to additional
       terms: (>5M MAU) or (>100M API calls per day) or (>50M impressions
       per day).
    6. Your website must offer an explicit "Log Out" option that also logs
       the user out of Facebook.
    7. Special provision for apps on Pages:
       a. When a user visits your Page, if they have not given explicit
       permission by authorizing your Facebook app or directly providing
       information to your Page, you may only use information obtained
       from us and the user's interaction with your Page in connection
       with that Page. For example, although you may use aggregate
       analytics for your individual Page, you must not combine
       information from any other sources to customize the user's
       experience on your Page and may not use any information about the
       user's interaction with your Page in any other context (such as
       analytics or customization across other Pages or websites).
    8. You must not use or make derivative use of Facebook icons, or use
       terms for Facebook features and functionality, if such use could
       confuse users into thinking that the reference is to Facebook
       features or functionality.
    9. Games that are an [17]App on Facebook or [18]Mobile Web must use
       Facebook Credits as their sole and exclusive payment method for all
       virtual goods and currencies made available to users within the
       game. All other payment options are prohibited within games that
       are on [19]Apps on Facebook or [20]Mobile Web unless they go
       through Facebook Credits rather than directly through that payment
       option. By “Payment Method” we mean any method that allows a user
       to complete a transaction where the user receives virtual currency
       or virtual goods in a game that is an [21]App on Facebook or
       [22]Mobile Web in exchange for anything of value, including,
       without limitation, by exchanging monetary value for virtual
       currency or virtual goods, whether directly at the time of purchase
       or via any previous transaction such as the user's earlier purchase
       of a prepaid gift card or electronic code. In-game rewards of
       virtual currency or virtual goods earned by users through game-play
       activity alone are exempt from this definition.
   10. [23]Mobile Web Apps that are running within a Facebook iOS app may
       only use iOS approved payment methods. These apps must not
       reference, use, or otherwise encourage use of Facebook Credits and
       other non-iOS approved payment methods.
   11. Applications may reward users with virtual currency or virtual
       goods in exchange for user actions that do not involve third
       parties, but rewards for user actions that involve third parties
       must be powered by Facebook Credits by integrating Facebook Credits
       offers. For example, you may not reward users with virtual currency
       or virtual goods in exchange for any action in which personally
       identifiable information is shared with a third party, you may not
       reward users with virtual currency or virtual goods in exchange for
       third party downloads, such as toolbars or ringtones, and you may
       not reward users with virtual currency for engaging in passive
       actions offered by third parties, such as watching a video, playing
       a mini-game, or taking an anonymous poll.
   12. [24]Apps on Facebook may not integrate, link to, promote,
       distribute, or redirect to any app on any other competing social
       platform.
   13. The primary purpose of your Canvas or Page Tab app on Facebook must
       not be to simply redirect users out of the Facebook experience and
       onto an external site.

II. Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us

    1. You will only request the data you need to operate your
       application.
    2. You may cache data you receive through use of the Facebook API in
       order to improve your application’s user experience, but you should
       try to keep the data up to date. This permission does not give you
       any rights to such data.
    3. You will have a privacy policy that tells users what user data you
       are going to use and how you will use, display, share, or transfer
       that data and you will include your privacy policy URL in the
       Developer Application.
    4. A user's friends' data can only be used in the context of the
       user's experience on your application.
    5. Subject to certain restrictions, including on transfer, users give
       you their [25]basic account information when they connect with your
       application. For all other data obtained through use of the
       Facebook API, you must obtain explicit consent from the user who
       provided the data to us before using it for any purpose other than
       displaying it back to the user on your application.
    6. You will not directly or indirectly transfer any data you receive
       from us, including user data or Facebook User IDs, to (or use such
       data in connection with) any ad network, ad exchange, data broker,
       or other advertising or monetization related toolset, even if a
       user consents to such transfer or use. By indirectly we mean you
       cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then
       transfers the data to an ad network. By any data we mean all data
       obtained through use of the Facebook Platform (API, Social Plugins,
       etc.), including aggregate, anonymous or derivative data.
    7. You will not use Facebook User IDs for any purpose outside your
       application (e.g., your infrastructure, code, or services necessary
       to build and run your application). Facebook User IDs may be used
       with external services that you use to build and run your
       application, such as a web infrastructure service or a distributed
       computing platform, but only if those services are necessary to
       running your application and the service has a contractual
       obligation with you to keep Facebook User IDs confidential.
    8. If you need an anonymous unique identifier to share outside your
       application with third parties such as content partners,
       advertisers, or ad networks, you must use our [26]mechanism. You
       must never share this anonymous unique identifier with a data
       broker, information broker, or any other service that we may define
       as such under our sole discretion.
    9. You will not sell any data. If you are acquired by or merge with a
       third party, you can continue to use user data within your
       application, but you cannot transfer data outside your application.
   10. If you stop using Platform or we disable your application, you must
       delete all data you have received through use of the Facebook API
       unless: (a) it is basic account information; or (b) you have
       received explicit consent from the user to retain their data.
   11. You cannot use a user’s friend list outside of your application,
       even if a user consents to such use, but you can use connections
       between users who have both connected to your application.
   12. You will delete all data you receive from us concerning a user if
       the user asks you to do so, and will provide an easily accessible
       mechanism for users to make such a request. We may require you to
       delete data you receive from the Facebook API if you violate our
       terms.
   13. You will not include data you receive from us concerning a user in
       any advertising creative, even if a user consents to such use.
   14. You must not give your secret key to another party, unless that
       party is an agent acting on your behalf as an operator of your
       application. You are responsible for all activities that occur
       under your account identifiers.

III. Application Content

A. Responsibility for Content

   You are responsible for all content of and within your application,
   including advertisements, user-generated content, and any content
   hosted, streamed or otherwise delivered to users by third parties. You
   must make it clear that this content is not provided by Facebook.

B. Prohibited Content

   You agree that you will not promote, or provide content referencing,
   facilitating, containing or using, the following:
    1. Alcohol-related content (unless the appropriate [27]Demographic
       Restrictions are used), or sale of tobacco products, ammunition
       and/or firearms;
    2. Content that infringes upon the rights of any third party,
       including intellectual property rights, privacy, publicity, moral
       or other personal or proprietary right, or that is deceptive or
       fraudulent;
    3. Online gambling, games of skill or lotteries, including online
       casinos, sports books, bingo, or poker.
    4. Illegal activity and/or illegal contests, pyramid schemes,
       sweepstakes or chain letters; if you run, reference, or facilitate
       a legally permissible sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion you
       are subject to Facebook's [28]Promotions Guidelines;
    5. Content that is hateful, threatening, defamatory, or pornographic;
       incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous
       violence.

C. Rights to Content

    1. You must ensure that you own or have secured all rights necessary
       to copy, display, distribute, deliver, render and publicly perform
       all content of or within your application to Facebook users in all
       countries where you make the content available.
    2. You are responsible for all licensing, reporting and payout
       obligations to third parties required in connection with content of
       or within your application.
    3. You must use commercially reasonable geo-filtering technology to
       block access to your application's content in countries where you
       are unauthorized to deliver such content, or where delivery of such
       content would otherwise infringe the rights of a third party.
    4. Although we have no obligation to do so, in our sole discretion we
       may request, and you are required to provide us, proof that your
       application and any content of or within your application is
       properly licensed.

D. Third Party Generated Content

   If your application contains content submitted or provided by third
   parties, you must comply with the following rules:
    1. In the United States you must take all steps required to fall
       within the applicable safe harbors of the Digital Millennium
       Copyright Act including designating an agent to receive notices of
       claimed infringement, instituting a repeat infringer termination
       policy and implementing a "notice and takedown" process. In other
       countries, you must comply with local copyright laws and ensure you
       implement an appropriate "notice and takedown" process upon
       receiving a notice of claimed infringement.

E. Advertisements and Cross-Promotions

    1. You must not include advertisements or promotions, cross-promote
       other applications, or provide web search functionality in content
       distributed through [29]Facebook social channels.
    2. You can only utilize advertising or similar monetization related
       products or services from companies that appear on this [30]list
       within [31]Apps on Facebook.com.

IV. Application Integration Points

    1. You must not incentivize users to use (or gate content behind the
       use of) [32]Facebook social channels, or imply that an incentive is
       directly tied to the use of our channels.
    2. You must not pre-fill any of the fields associated with the
       following products, unless the user manually generated the content
       earlier in the workflow: Stream stories (user_message parameter for
       Facebook.streamPublish and FB.Connect.streamPublish, and message
       parameter for stream.publish), Photos (caption), Videos
       (description), Notes (title and content), Links (comment), and
       Jabber/XMPP.
    3. If a user grants you a publishing [33]permission, you must still
       obtain consent from the user before taking any action on the user's
       behalf, such as publishing content or creating an event.
    4. Platform integrations, including social plugins:
       a. Your advertisements must not include or be paired with any
       Platform integrations, including social plugins such as the Like
       button, without our written permission.
       b. You must not sell or purchase placement of a Like button or Like
       box plugin.
       c. You must not incentivize users to Like any Page other than your
       own site or application, and any incentive you provide must be
       available to new and existing users who Like your Page.
       d. You must not obscure or cover elements of our social plugins,
       such as the Like button or Like box plugin.
       e. Ad networks, ad exchanges, and data brokers must not use
       Facebook’s Platform, logos, and trademarks (including, but not
       limited to, Platform APIs, social plugins, the Share button, and
       the F logo).
    5. Facebook messaging (i.e., email sent to an @facebook.com address)
       is designed for communication between users, and not a channel for
       applications to communicate directly with users.

V. Enforcement

   We can take enforcement action against you and any or all of your
   applications if we determine in our sole judgment that you or your
   application violates Facebook Platform Terms and Policies. Enforcement
   action is both automated and manual, and can include disabling your
   application, restricting you and your application's access to Platform
   functionality, terminating our agreements with you, or any other action
   as we in our sole discretion deem appropriate.

   Communication with developers takes place via an email sent from the
   facebook.com or facebookmail.com domain to the Developer Contact email
   address registered to the application. To stay in touch, please ensure
   that your email address is current and that you do not filter out any
   such messages.

VI. Changes

   We can change these Platform Policies at any time without prior notice
   as we deem necessary. Your continued use of Platform constitutes
   acceptance of those changes.

VII. Definitions

    1. By "Application" we mean canvas page application, Platform
       integration, or any other technical integration we have assigned an
       application identification number.
    2. By "Facebook social channel" we mean Application Info Section, Page
       Tab, Feed, Requests (including invites), inbox attachments, Chat,
       Cover, Bookmarks, or any other feature of a user profile or
       Facebook communication channel in which or through which an
       application can provide, display, or deliver content directed at,
       on behalf of, or by permission of a user.
    3. By “basic account information” we mean: name, email, gender,
       birthday, current city, and profile picture URL.
    4. By "Facebook Platform Terms and Policies" we mean the Statement of
       Rights and Responsibilities and the Platform Policies.
    5. By "User data you receive from Facebook" we mean any data or
       content (including any images, text, or other information or
       materials) you receive from us, that was provided by users to us,
       or was associated by us with a particular user.

VIII. Branding and Promotion Policy

   You must follow the guidelines set forth in the [34]Facebook Brand
   Resource and Permissions Center.

IX. [35]Advertising Guidelines

X. [36]Facebook Credits

   Developers participating in the program for accepting credits are
   subject to [37]these terms.

XI. Ads API

    1. You must use separate accounts for each client and use our
       multi-client manager functionality to structure your client
       accounts.
    2. You may offer a white-label version of your application to third
       parties, but may only do so by creating a unique application for
       each third party (or requiring each third party to create their own
       application), and then requesting that we grant these applications
       access to our Ads API. If you create a unique application on behalf
       of the third party, you must include a required field for your
       clients to agree to Facebook Terms and Policies.
    3. You must, upon request, provide advertisers with a report on their
       ad spend, and your report must itemize how much advertisers spend
       on Facebook ads and fees for your service.

Examples and Explanations

   We want you to be successful on Facebook Platform, and we believe that
   the best way to do so is to provide a great user experience. Our
   Platform Policies will help you do this by explaining what’s required;
   these [38]examples and explanations will help you understand how to put
   that into practice.
