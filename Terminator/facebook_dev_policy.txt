Facebook Platform Policies

Introduction

   Date of Last Revision: August 12, 2011

   Facebook Platform is an extension of Facebook, whose mission is to give
   people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.

   Platform applications and developers are required to comply with the
   following documents:
     * [10]Statement of Rights and Responsibilities: requirements for
       anyone who uses Facebook.
     * [11]Principles: the spirit of the law for Platform.
     * [12]Policies: the letter of the law for Platform.

   Here are some [13]Examples and Explanations for specifics.
     __________________________________________________________________

Principles

   Create a great user experience
     * Build social and engaging applications
     * Give users choice and control
     * Help users share expressive and relevant content

   Be trustworthy
     * Respect privacy
     * Don't mislead, confuse, defraud, or surprise users
     * Don't spam - encourage authentic communications
     __________________________________________________________________

Policies

   I. Features and Functionality
    1. You must not violate any law or the rights of any individual or
       entity, and must not expose Facebook or Facebook users to harm or
       legal liability as determined by us in our sole discretion.
    2. You must not include functionality that proxies, requests or
       collects Facebook usernames or passwords.
    3. You must not circumvent (or claim to circumvent) our intended
       limitations on core Facebook features and functionality.
    4. If you offer a service for a user that integrates user data into a
       physical product (such as a scrapbook or calendar), you must only
       create a physical product for that user's personal and
       non-commercial use.
    5. If you exceed, or plan to exceed, any of the following thresholds
       please [14]contact us as you may be subject to additional terms:
       (>5M MAU) or (>100M API calls per day) or (>50M impressions per
       day).
    6. Your website must offer an explicit "Log Out" option that also logs
       the user out of Facebook.
    7. Special provisions for apps on Pages:
        a. Apps on Pages must not host media that plays automatically
            without a user's interaction.
            b. When a user visits your Page, if they have not given
            explicit permission by authorizing your Facebook app or
            directly providing information to your Page, you may only use
            information obtained from us and the user's interaction with
            your Page in connection with that Page. For example, although
            you may use aggregate analytics for your individual Page, you
            must not combine information from any other sources to
            customize the user's experience on your Page and may not use
            any information about the user's interaction with your Page in
            any other context (such as analytics or customization across
            other Pages or websites).
    8. You must not use or make derivative use of Facebook icons, or use
       terms for Facebook features and functionality, if such use could
       confuse users into thinking that the reference is to Facebook
       features or functionality.
    9. Games on [15]Canvas Pages must use Facebook Credits as their sole
       and exclusive payment method for all virtual goods and currencies
       made available to users within the game. All other payment options
       are prohibited within games on [16]Canvas Pages unless they go
       through Facebook Credits rather than directly through that payment
       option. By “Payment Method” we mean any method that allows a user
       to complete a transaction where the user receives virtual currency
       or virtual goods in a game on a [17]Canvas Page in exchange for
       anything of value, including, without limitation, by exchanging
       monetary value for virtual currency or virtual goods, whether
       directly at the time of purchase or via any previous transaction
       such as the user's earlier purchase of a prepaid gift card or
       electronic code. In-game rewards of virtual currency or virtual
       goods earned by users through game-play activity alone are exempt
       from this definition.
   10. Applications may reward users with virtual currency or virtual
       goods in exchange for user actions that do not involve third
       parties, but rewards for user actions that involve third parties
       must be powered by Facebook Credits by integrating Facebook Credits
       offers. For example, you may not reward users with virtual currency
       or virtual goods in exchange for any action in which personally
       identifiable information is shared with a third party, you may not
       reward users with virtual currency or virtual goods in exchange for
       third party downloads, such as toolbars or ringtones, and you may
       not reward users with virtual currency for engaging in passive
       actions offered by third parties, such as watching a video, playing
       a mini-game, or taking an anonymous poll.
   11. Apps on Facebook may not integrate, link to, promote, distribute,
       or redirect to any app on any other competing social platform.

   II. Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us
    1. You will only request the data you need to operate your
       application.
    2. You may cache data you receive through use of the Facebook API in
       order to improve your application’s user experience, but you should
       try to keep the data up to date. This permission does not give you
       any rights to such data.
    3. You will have a privacy policy that tells users what user data you
       are going to use and how you will use, display, share, or transfer
       that data and you will include your privacy policy URL in the
       Developer Application.
    4. A user's friends' data can only be used in the context of the
       user's experience on your application.
    5. Subject to certain restrictions, including on transfer, users give
       you their [18]basic account information when they connect with your
       application. For all other data obtained through use of the
       Facebook API, you must obtain explicit consent from the user who
       provided the data to us before using it for any purpose other than
       displaying it back to the user on your application.
    6. You will not directly or indirectly transfer any data you receive
       from us, including user data or Facebook User IDs, to (or use such
       data in connection with) any ad network, ad exchange, data broker,
       or other advertising or monetization related toolset, even if a
       user consents to such transfer or use. By indirectly we mean you
       cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then
       transfers the data to an ad network. By any data we mean all data
       obtained through use of the Facebook Platform (API, Social Plugins,
       etc.), including aggregate, anonymous or derivative data.
    7. You will not use Facebook User IDs for any purpose outside your
       application (e.g., your infrastructure, code, or services necessary
       to build and run your application). Facebook User IDs may be used
       with external services that you use to build and run your
       application, such as a web infrastructure service or a distributed
       computing platform, but only if those services are necessary to
       running your application and the service has a contractual
       obligation with you to keep Facebook User IDs confidential.
    8. If you need an anonymous unique identifier to share outside your
       application with third parties such as content partners,
       advertisers, or ad networks, you must use our [19]mechanism. You
       must never share this anonymous unique identifier with a data
       broker, information broker, or any other service that we may define
       as such under our sole discretion.
    9. You will not sell any data. If you are acquired by or merge with a
       third party, you can continue to use user data within your
       application, but you cannot transfer data outside your application.
   10. If you stop using Platform or we disable your application, you must
       delete all data you have received through use of the Facebook API
       unless: (a) it is basic account information; or (b) you have
       received explicit consent from the user to retain their data.
   11. You cannot use a user’s friend list outside of your application,
       even if a user consents to such use, but you can use connections
       between users who have both connected to your application.
   12. You will delete all data you receive from us concerning a user if
       the user asks you to do so, and will provide an easily accessible
       mechanism for users to make such a request. We may require you to
       delete data you receive from the Facebook API if you violate our
       terms.
   13. You will not include data you receive from us concerning a user in
       any advertising creative, even if a user consents to such use.
   14. You must not give your secret key to another party, unless that
       party is an agent acting on your behalf as an operator of your
       application. You are responsible for all activities that occur
       under your account identifiers.

   III. Application Content
   A. Prohibited Content - You are responsible for all content of and
       within your application, including advertisements and
       user-generated content. You must not promote, or provide content
       referencing, facilitating, containing or using, the following:

    1. Alcohol-related content (unless the appropriate [20]Demographic
       Restrictions are used), or sale of tobacco products, ammunition
       and/or firearms;
    2. Content that infringes upon the rights of any third party,
       including intellectual property rights, privacy, publicity or other
       personal or proprietary right, or that is deceptive or fraudulent;
    3. Gambling, including without limitation, any online casino, sports
       books, bingo or poker;
    4. Illegal activity and/or illegal contests, pyramid schemes,
       sweepstakes or chain letters; if you run, reference, or facilitate
       a legally permissible sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion you
       are subject to Facebook's [21]Promotions Guidelines;
    5. Content that is hateful, threatening, defamatory, or pornographic;
       incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous
       violence.

   B. Advertisements and Cross-Promotions
    1. You must not include advertisements or promotions, cross-promote
       other applications, or provide web search functionality in content
       distributed through [22]Facebook social channels.
    2. You can only utilize advertising or similar monetization related
       products or services from companies that appear on this [23]list
       within [24]Apps on Facebook.com.

   IV. Application Integration Points
    1. You must not incentivize users to use (or gate content behind the
       use of) Facebook social channels, or imply that an incentive is
       directly tied to the use of our channels.
    2. You must not pre-fill any of the fields associated with the
       following products, unless the user manually generated the content
       earlier in the workflow: Stream stories (user_message parameter for
       Facebook.streamPublish and FB.Connect.streamPublish, and message
       parameter for stream.publish), Photos (caption), Videos
       (description), Notes (title and content), Links (comment), and
       Jabber/XMPP.
    3. If a user grants you a publishing [25]permission, you must still
       obtain consent from the user before taking any action on the user's
       behalf, such as publishing content or creating an event.
    4. Platform integrations, including social plugins:
        a. Your advertisements must not include or be paired with any
            Platform integrations, including social plugins such as the
            Like button, without our written permission.
            b. You must not sell or purchase placement of a Like button or
            Like box plugin.
            c. You must not incentivize users to Like any Page other than
            your own site or application, and any incentive you provide
            must be available to new and existing users who Like your
            Page.
            d. You must not obscure or cover elements of our social
            plugins, such as the Like button or Like box plugin.
            e. Ad networks, ad exchanges, and data brokers must not use
            Facebook’s Platform, logos, and trademarks (including, but not
            limited to, Platform APIs, social plugins, the Share button,
            and the F logo).
    5. Facebook messaging (i.e., email sent to an @facebook.com address)
       is designed for communication between users, and not a channel for
       applications to communicate directly with users.

   V. Enforcement

   We can take enforcement action against you and any or all of your
   applications if we determine in our sole judgment that you or your
   application violates Facebook Platform Terms and Policies. Enforcement
   action is both automated and manual, and can include disabling your
   application, restricting you and your application's access to Platform
   functionality, terminating our agreements with you, or any other action
   as we in our sole discretion deem appropriate.

   Communication with developers takes place via an email sent from the
   facebook.com or facebookmail.com domain to the Developer Contact email
   address registered to the application. To stay in touch, please ensure
   that your email address is current and that you do not filter out any
   such messages.

   VI. Changes

   We can change these Platform Policies at any time without prior notice
   as we deem necessary. Your continued use of Platform constitutes
   acceptance of those changes.

   VII. Definitions
    1. By "Application" we mean canvas page application, Platform
       integration, or any other technical integration we have assigned an
       application identification number.
    2. By "Facebook social channel" we mean Application Info Section, Page
       Tab, Feed, Requests (including invites), inbox attachments, Chat,
       Bookmarks, or any other feature of a user profile or Facebook
       communication channel in which or through which an application can
       provide, display, or deliver content directed at, on behalf of, or
       by permission of a user.
    3. By “basic account information” we mean: name, email, gender,
       birthday, current city, and profile picture URL.
    4. By "Facebook Platform Terms and Policies" we mean the Statement of
       Rights and Responsibilities and the Platform Policies.
    5. By "User data you receive from Facebook" we mean any data or
       content (including any images, text, or other information or
       materials) you receive from us, that was provided by users to us,
       or was associated by us with a particular user.

   VIII. Branding and Promotion Policy

   You must follow the guidelines set forth in the [26]Facebook Brand
   Resource and Permissions Center.

   IX. [27]Advertising Guidelines

   X. [28]Facebook Credits

   subject to [29]these terms.

   XI. Ads API
    1. You must use separate accounts for each client and use our
       multi-client manager functionality to structure your client
       accounts.
    2. You may offer a white-label version of your application to third
       parties, but may only do so by creating a unique application for
       each third party (or requiring each third party to create their own
       application), and then requesting that we grant these applications
       access to our Ads API. If you create a unique application on behalf
       of the third party, you must include a required field for your
       clients to agree to Facebook Terms and Policies.
    3. You must, upon request, provide advertisers with a report on their
       ad spend, and your report must itemize how much advertisers spend
       on Facebook ads and fees for your service.
