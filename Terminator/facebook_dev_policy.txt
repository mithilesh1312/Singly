     __________________________________________________________________

Policies

I. Features and Functionality

    1. You must not violate any law or the rights of any individual or
       entity, and must not expose Facebook or Facebook users to harm or
       legal liability as determined by us in our sole discretion. In
       particular you will (if applicable): comply with the Video Privacy
       Protection Act (VPPA), and obtain any opt-in consent necessary from
       users so that user data subject to the VPPA may be shared on
       Facebook. You represent that any disclosure to us will not be
       incidental to the ordinary course of your business.
    2. You must not include functionality that proxies, requests or
       collects Facebook usernames or passwords.
    3. You must not circumvent (or claim to circumvent) our intended
       limitations on core Facebook features and functionality.
    4. If you offer a service for a user that integrates user data into a
       physical product (such as a scrapbook or calendar), you must only
       create a physical product for that user's personal and
       non-commercial use.
    5. If you exceed, or plan to exceed, any of the following thresholds
       please [17]contact us as you may be subject to additional terms:
       (>5M MAU) or (>100M API calls per day) or (>50M impressions per
       day).
    6. Your website must offer an explicit "Log Out" option that also logs
       the user out of Facebook.
    7. Special provision for apps on Pages: When a user visits your Page,
       if they have not given explicit permission by authorizing your
       Facebook app or directly providing information to your Page, you
       may only use information obtained from us and the user's
       interaction with your Page in connection with that Page. For
       example, although you may use aggregate analytics for your
       individual Page, you must not combine information from any other
       sources to customize the user's experience on your Page and may not
       use any information about the user's interaction with your Page in
       any other context (such as analytics or customization across other
       Pages or websites).
    8. You must not use or make derivative use of Facebook icons, or use
       terms for Facebook features and functionality, if such use could
       confuse users into thinking that the reference is to Facebook
       features or functionality.
    9. Mobile Web Apps that are running within the Facebook iOS app must
       not accept payments. In particular, these apps must not reference,
       use, or otherwise encourage the use of Facebook Payments or other
       non-iOS approved payment methods.
   10. Reciprocity and Replicating core functionality: (a) Reciprocity:
       Facebook Platform enables developers to build personalized, social
       experiences via the Graph API and related APIs. If you use any
       Facebook APIs to build personalized or social experiences, you must
       also enable people to easily share their experiences back with
       people on Facebook. (b) Replicating core functionality: You may not
       use Facebook Platform to promote, or to export user data to, a
       product or service that replicates a core Facebook product or
       service without our permission.
   11. The primary purpose of your Canvas or Page Tab app on Facebook must
       not be to simply redirect users out of the Facebook experience and
       onto an external site.
   12. You must not include data obtained from us in any search engine or
       directory without our written permission.
   13. Special provisions for games:
       a. Desktop web games off of [18]Facebook.com may only use Facebook
       Login ([19]Authentication, excluding user connections such as
       friend list), [20]Social Plugins and publishing (e.g., Feed Dialog,
       Stream Publish, or Open Graph). When authenticating, these games
       may not request [21]additional permissions other than age, email,
       and our [22]Publishing Permissions.
       b. Games on [23]Facebook.com and mobile must not share the same app
       ID with desktop web games off of [24]Facebook.com. You must not use
       [25]Canvas apps to promote or link to game sites off of Facebook,
       and must not use emails obtained from us to promote or link to
       desktop web games off of [26]Facebook.com.
       c. Games on [27]Facebook.com or Mobile Web must use Facebook
       Payments as their sole and exclusive payment method for all virtual
       goods and currencies made available to users within the game. All
       other payment options are prohibited within games on
       [28]Facebook.com or Mobile Web unless they go through Facebook
       Payments rather than directly through that payment option. By
       “Payment Method” we mean any method that allows a user to complete
       a transaction in a game that is on [29]Facebook.com or Mobile Web,
       including, without limitation, by exchanging monetary value for
       virtual currency or virtual goods, whether directly at the time of
       purchase or via any previous transaction such as the user's earlier
       purchase of a prepaid gift card or electronic code. In-game rewards
       of virtual currency or virtual goods earned by users through
       game-play activity alone are exempt from this definition.
       d. Games on [30]Facebook.com or Mobile Web may reward users with
       virtual currency or virtual goods in exchange for user actions that
       do not involve third parties, but rewards for user actions that
       involve third parties must be powered by Facebook Payments by
       integrating Facebook Payments offers. For example, you may not
       reward users with virtual currency or virtual goods in exchange for
       any action in which personally identifiable information is shared
       with a third party, you may not reward users with virtual currency
       or virtual goods in exchange for third party downloads, such as
       toolbars or ringtones, and you may not reward users with virtual
       currency for engaging in passive actions offered by third parties,
       such as watching a video, playing a mini-game, or taking an
       anonymous poll.

II. Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us

    1. You will only request the data you need to operate your
       application.
    2. You may cache data you receive through use of the Facebook API in
       order to improve your application’s user experience, but you should
       try to keep the data up to date. This permission does not give you
       any rights to such data.
    3. You will have a privacy policy that tells users what user data you
       are going to use and how you will use, display, share, or transfer
       that data. In addition, you will include your privacy policy URL in
       the App Dashboard, and must also include a link to your app's
       privacy policy in any app marketplace that provides you with the
       functionality to do so.
    4. Until you display a conspicuous link to your privacy policy in your
       app, any data accessed by your app (including basic account
       information) may only be used in the context of the user's
       experience in that app. A user's friends' data can only be used in
       the context of the user's experience on your application.
    5. Subject to certain restrictions, including on use and transfer,
       users give you their [31]basic account information when they
       connect with your application. For all other data obtained through
       use of the Facebook API, you must obtain explicit consent from the
       user who provided the data to us before using it for any purpose
       other than displaying it back to the user on your application.
    6. You will not directly or indirectly transfer any data you receive
       from us, including user data or Facebook User IDs, to (or use such
       data in connection with) any ad network, ad exchange, data broker,
       or other advertising or monetization related toolset, even if a
       user consents to such transfer or use. By indirectly we mean you
       cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then
       transfers the data to an ad network. By any data we mean all data
       obtained through use of the Facebook Platform (API, Social Plugins,
       etc.), including aggregate, anonymous or derivative data.
    7. You will not use Facebook User IDs for any purpose outside your
       application (e.g., your infrastructure, code, or services necessary
       to build and run your application). Facebook User IDs may be used
       with external services that you use to build and run your
       application, such as a web infrastructure service or a distributed
       computing platform, but only if those services are necessary to
       running your application and the service has a contractual
       obligation with you to keep Facebook User IDs confidential.
    8. If you need an anonymous unique identifier to share outside your
       application with third parties such as content partners,
       advertisers, or ad networks, you must use our [32]mechanism. You
       must never share this anonymous unique identifier with a data
       broker, information broker, or any other service that we may define
       as such under our sole discretion.
    9. You will not sell or purchase any data obtained from us by anyone.
       If you are acquired by or merge with a third party, you can
       continue to use user data within your application, but you cannot
       transfer data outside your application.
   10. If you stop using Platform or we disable your application, you must
       delete all information about a user you have received from us
       unless: (a) it is basic account information; or (b) you have
       received explicit consent from the user to retain their data.
   11. You cannot use a user’s friend list outside of your application,
       even if a user consents to such use, but you can use connections
       between users who have both connected to your application.
   12. You will delete all data you receive from us concerning a user if
       the user asks you to do so, and will provide an easily accessible
       mechanism for users to make such a request. We may require you to
       delete data you receive from the Facebook API if you violate our
       terms.
   13. You will not include data you receive from us concerning a user in
       any advertising creative, even if a user consents to such use.
   14. You must not give your secret key and access tokens to another
       party, unless that party is an agent acting on your behalf as an
       operator of your application. You are responsible for all
       activities that occur under your account identifiers.

III. Content

A. General

    1. Responsibility for content: You are responsible for all content of
       and within your application, including advertisements,
       user-generated content, and any content hosted, streamed or
       otherwise delivered to users by third parties. You must make it
       clear that this content is not provided by Facebook. You must also
       comply with the [33]Facebook Community Standards.
    2. Demographic restrictions: You are responsible for restricting
       access to your content in accordance with our content policies and
       all applicable laws and regulations. Although we [34]provide
       controls to assist with this, please note that we make no
       representations regarding the sufficiency of any controls provided
       to you and that you are ultimately responsible for establishing
       legally compliant restrictions for each country where your app is
       visible.
    3. Advertisements and cross-promotions:
       a. You must not include advertisements, cross-promote other
       applications, or provide web search functionality in content
       distributed through [35]Facebook social channels.
       b. You can only utilize advertising or similar monetization related
       products or services from companies that appear on this [36]list of
       Advertising Providers within [37]Apps on Facebook.com.
    4. Promotions: If you run, reference, or facilitate a promotion
       (contest, competition, or sweepstake) on Facebook, you must comply
       with Facebook’s [38]Promotions Guidelines.
    5. Permission from Facebook: You must not promote, or provide content
       referencing, facilitating, or containing online gambling, online
       real money games of skill or online lotteries without our written
       permission.
    6. Quality of content: you are responsible for providing users with a
       quality experience and must not confuse, defraud, mislead, spam or
       surprise users. For example, you must monitor your app's negative
       feedback in [39]Application Insights to ensure it stays below our
       thresholds, avoid excessive advertisements or bugs, and ensure the
       description of your app is consistent with your app's content.

B. Content Rights

    1. You agree that you will not promote or provide content that
       references, facilitates, contains or uses content that infringes
       upon the rights of any third party, including intellectual property
       rights, privacy, publicity, moral or other personal or proprietary
       rights, or that is deceptive or fraudulent.
    2. You must ensure that you own or have secured all rights necessary
       to copy, display, distribute, deliver, render and publicly perform
       all content of or within your application to Facebook users in all
       countries where you make the content available.
    3. You are responsible for all licensing, reporting and payout
       obligations to third parties required in connection with content of
       or within your application.
    4. You must use commercially reasonable geo-filtering technology to
       block access to your application's content in countries where you
       are unauthorized to deliver such content, or where delivery of such
       content would otherwise infringe the rights of a third party.
    5. Although we have no obligation to do so, in our sole discretion we
       may request, and you are required to provide us, proof that your
       application and any content of or within your application is
       properly licensed.

C. Third Party Content

   If your application contains content submitted or provided by third
   parties, you must comply with the following rules:
    1. In the United States you must take all steps required to fall
       within the applicable safe harbors of the Digital Millennium
       Copyright Act including designating an agent to receive notices of
       claimed infringement, instituting a repeat infringer termination
       policy and implementing a "notice and takedown" process. In other
       countries, you must comply with local copyright laws and implement
       an appropriate "notice and takedown" process upon receiving a
       notice of claimed infringement.

IV. Application Integration Points

    1. You must not incentivize users to use (or gate content behind the
       use of) [40]Facebook social channels, or imply that an incentive is
       directly tied to the use of our channels.
    2. You must not pre-fill any of the fields associated with the
       following products, unless the user manually generated the content
       earlier in the workflow: Stream stories (user_message parameter for
       Facebook.streamPublish and FB.Connect.streamPublish, and message
       parameter for stream.publish), Photos (caption), Videos
       (description), Notes (title and content), Links (comment), and
       Jabber/XMPP.
    3. If a user grants you a publishing [41]permission, actions you take
       on the user's behalf must be expected by the user and consistent
       with the user's actions within your app.
    4. Platform integrations, including social plugins:
       a. Your advertisements must not include or be paired with any
       Platform integrations, including social plugins such as the Like
       button, without our written permission.
       b. You must not sell or purchase placement of our [42]Social
       Plugins, and must not facilitate or participate in any like
       exchange program.
       c. You must not incentivize users to Like any Page other than your
       own site or application, and any incentive you provide must be
       available to new and existing users who Like your Page.
       d. You must not obscure or cover elements of our social plugins,
       such as the Like button or Like box plugin.
       e. Ad networks, ad exchanges, and data brokers must not use
       Facebook’s Platform, logos, and trademarks (including, but not
       limited to, Platform APIs, social plugins, the Share button, and
       the F logo).
    5. Facebook messaging (i.e., email sent to an @facebook.com address)
       is designed for communication between users, and not a channel for
       applications to communicate directly with users.
    6. [43]Requests: you may not offer a select all option or pre-select
       multiple recipients to receive a Request (effective October 2,
       2013).

V. Enforcement

   We can take enforcement action against you and any or all of your
   applications if we determine in our sole judgment that you or your
   application violates Facebook Platform Terms and Policies. Enforcement
   action is both automated and manual, and can include disabling your
   application, restricting you and your application's access to Platform
   functionality, terminating our agreements with you, or any other action
   as we in our sole discretion deem appropriate.

   Communication with developers takes place via an email sent from the
   facebook.com or facebookmail.com domain to the contact email address
   registered to the application. To stay in touch, please ensure that
   your email address is current and that you do not filter out any such
   messages.

VI. Changes

   We can change these Platform Policies at any time without prior notice
   as we deem necessary. Your continued use of Platform constitutes
   acceptance of those changes.

VII. Definitions

    1. By "Application" we mean canvas page application, Platform
       integration, or any other technical integration we have assigned an
       application identification number.
    2. By "Facebook social channel" we mean Application Info Section, Page
       Tab, Feed, Requests (including invites), inbox attachments, Chat,
       Cover, Bookmarks, or any other feature of a user profile or
       Facebook communication channel in which or through which an
       application can provide, display, or deliver content directed at,
       on behalf of, or by permission of a user.
    3. By “basic account information” we mean: name, email, gender,
       birthday, current city, and profile picture URL.
    4. By "Facebook Platform Terms and Policies" we mean the Statement of
       Rights and Responsibilities and the Platform Policies.
    5. By "User data you receive from Facebook" we mean any data or
       content (including any images, text, or other information or
       materials) you receive from us, that was provided by users to us,
       or was associated by us with a particular user.

VIII. Branding and Promotion Policy

    1. You must follow the guidelines set forth in the [44]Facebook Brand
       Resource and Permissions Center.
    2. Your app's description, display name and icons must adhere to our
       [45]Advertising Guidelines.

IX. [46]Advertising Guidelines

X. [47]Facebook Developer Payments Terms

   Developers participating in the program for accepting payments are
   subject to [48]these terms.

XI. Ads API

    1. Separate apps: You must use separate apps for your staging,
       self-service, managed service, and white-labeled apps. If you offer
       a white-label version of your app, you must only do so by creating
       a unique app for each end-advertiser (or requiring each
       end-advertiser to create their own app) and you must include a
       required field for the third party to agree to Facebook's Platform
       Policies.
    2. Separate ad accounts: You must use separate ad accounts for each
       end-advertiser and use our multi-client manager functionality to
       structure your end-advertiser accounts. You must never combine
       multiple end-advertisers within the same ad account, and this
       includes their Facebook connections (ex: pages and apps).
    3. Freemium: If you offer a free or trial version of an ads API app,
       you must allow no more than 50 ad creations per day per customer,
       require phone or email verification for all new accounts, and
       prohibit affiliate networks from using your technology.
    4. Pricing transparency: You must only charge fees for the use of your
       tools and managed services, and must only do so on a fixed fee (per
       campaign or period) or variable percentage of ad spend. You must
       disclose to your clients the actual amount that you spent on
       Facebook advertising based on the auction pricing, including the
       actual Facebook metrics (e.g. CPC, CPM rate) and the amount you
       charged as fees. We reserve the right to disclose this information
       to your client upon their request. We may require documentation
       from you to ensure your compliance with this policy.
    5. Data collection and use:
       a. You may place 1x1 pixel view tags on certain advertisements with
       our prior authorization.
       b. All data collected or obtained by you or the end-advertiser,
       including but not limited to all view tag data that is not
       otherwise available through the Facebook service, and all data
       derived therefrom, may only be used by you or the end-advertiser on
       an anonymous basis to optimize and measure the performance of that
       end-advertiser's Facebook campaign. Neither you nor the
       end-advertiser may use data for the following purposes: retargeting
       whether on or off of the Facebook service; to commingle the data
       across multiple campaigns; to build or augment any user profiles,
       or to use piggybacking or redirects with the 1x1 pixel tags, or for
       any other purpose not expressly authorized by us.
       c. You must not permit any person (other than an agent acting on
       the end-advertiser's behalf) to access the end-advertiser's Ad or
       Sponsored Story advertising statistics, including but not limited
       to, fixed CPM rates and any other raw, aggregate, or anonymous
       statistics derived from this data.
    6. Separate Reporting: If you use last-click attribution, create
       reporting tools that separate Facebook reporting from other
       channels. For example, don't create reporting dashboards that
       directly compare Facebook Ads metrics to search or display
       marketing metrics on a last-click basis. If you support other
       channels, you must either create a separate Facebook tool, include
       Facebook metrics in a separate Facebook section of your tool, or
       show multi-touch attribution results side-by-side with last-click
       attribution results. You may report Facebook mobile ads ROI metrics
       as they relate to other mobile ads channels.
    7. Self-service reporting for Homepage ads: You must include a
       self-service reporting dashboard, through which end-advertisers may
       access up-to-date reports (raw ad statistics) for all available
       data points of their Homepage Ad and Sponsored Story campaigns.
    8. Bidding types: You must implement all bidding types, including
       Optimized CPM, and you must not default to a specific type (ex: you
       must not default to CPC and hide oCPM).
    9. Custom Audiences:
       a. If you use custom audiences you must comply with the [49]Custom
       Audience Terms.
       b. You may create a custom audience on a client's behalf but must
       only use the client's customer data to do so (ex: you must not
       collect or provide any additional data to create a custom
       audience).
       c. You must not use Facebook User IDs to create custom audiences
       unless the person associated with the User ID has logged into your
       client's app and your client has secured any necessary consent from
       that person (ex: you must not create a custom audience based on
       users who have engaged with a Facebook Page).
       d. You must not sell custom audiences, and must not transfer a
       custom audience to anyone without our permission.
       e. Your custom audience tool may provide the same functionality and
       targeting options that Facebook provides, but you must not provide
       additional data or targeting options.
   10. Enforcement: You must immediately revoke an end-advertiser's access
       to your app upon our request.

Examples and Explanations

   We want you to be successful on Facebook Platform, and we believe that
   the best way to do so is to provide a great user experience. Our
   Platform Policies will help you do this by explaining what’s required;
   these [50]examples and explanations will help you understand how to put
   that into practice.
