Flickr Ad Free, Flickr Pro, and Doublr Additional Terms of Service

   [16]Click here to review the Flickr Gift Purchaser Terms.
    1. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF YAHOO! INC’S ADDITIONAL TERMS OF
       SERVICE FOR FLICKR AD FREE, FLICKR PRO, AND DOUBLR
       Welcome to the Flickr Ad Free, Flickr Pro or Doublr service
       (“Flickr Services”). The Flickr Services are only available for
       purchase in U.S. dollars and are offered by Yahoo! Inc.’s
       U.S.-based Flickr service (“Yahoo”). By using any of the Flickr
       Services you agree to these Additional Terms of Service
       (“Additional Terms”) at [17]https://www.flickr.com/atos/services
       (and any successor pages). The Additional Terms supplement the
       Yahoo Terms of Service (“TOS”) at
       [18]https://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/terms/ and the Yahoo
       Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) located at
       [19]https://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/ (and any successor
       pages to the TOS and Privacy Policy), both of which are
       incorporated by reference. You further agree to comply with the
       Flickr Community Guidelines (“Community Guidelines”) at
       [20]https://www.flickr.com/guidelines.gne (and any successor
       pages), which is incorporated by reference. If there is any
       conflict between the terms and conditions of these Additional Terms
       and those in the TOS, the terms and conditions of these Additional
       Terms will control.
       Yahoo reserves the right to update and change, from time to time,
       these Additional Terms and all documents incorporated by reference.
       You can always find the most recent version of this Additional
       Terms and the most recent version of the TOS, Privacy Policy, and
       the Community Guidelines at the URLs above.
       At the end of your subscription term when you have no paid Flickr
       Services, your account (and all associated data) will revert back
       to a free Flickr account and you will be governed by the Yahoo
       Terms of Service and Privacy Policy you have agreed to when you
       registered your Yahoo account, which may be different from the
       Yahoo Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that govern the Flickr
       Services.

       Please click this link to learn what additional features Doublr
       provides: [23]https://www.flickr.com/help/limits/#150470666.
    3. REGISTRATION AND PARTICIPATION
       To participate in the Flickr Services, you must have a valid Yahoo
       ID. You must provide Yahoo your credit card number, billing and
       shipping information and other information (“Registration Data”),
       which will be stored. You agree that the Registration Data is
       valid, and complete and you will maintain and promptly update that
       information to keep it valid and complete. If you do not have a
       Yahoo ID, you will be prompted to register for one before you can
       pay for a service.
       You, and not Yahoo, are responsible for all purchases (including
       any unauthorized purchases or errors) made with your Yahoo ID. You
       must resolve purchase-related disputes with and promptly report
       unauthorized use of your credit card to your credit card company,
       online payment service provider, merchant, or bank. Your liability
       for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your card
       issuer’s agreement and/or by applicable law. In addition to the
       uses of account information authorized by the TOS, Yahoo may
       access, preserve, monitor and disclose your card information in the
       good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to
       verify your account, to identify or resolve problems, or to respond
       to inquiries about any of your Flickr Services, but nothing in this
       section shall impose a duty on Yahoo to make any such disclosures.
    4. PAYMENT, ACCOUNT UPDATER, FRAUD PROTECTIONS AND TERMINATION
         1. Payment Terms
            Your credit card will automatically be charged the current fee
            for the Flickr Service you choose on the date that you click
            the “Submit order” button in the ordering process. If you do
            not cancel the Flickr Service you ordered by the end of the
            current term, your credit card on file will also automatically
            be charged the then-current fee for that service at the
            commencement of each renewal term. Fees can not be credited
            towards other services. Current fees are posted on Flickr at
            [24]https://www.flickr.com/help/limits/#150470666. All
            currency references are in U.S. dollars. Please note, payment
            for the Service is non-refundable, unless Yahoo expressly
            provides otherwise. To cancel the Service visit
            [25]https://flickr.com/account/wallet. If you cancel you will
            continue to keep the service until the end of your
            subscription term.
         2. Account Updater
            As a convenience to its users, Yahoo may subscribe to a third
            party service that can attempt to refresh expired credit card
            or debit card numbers with the numbers of replacement cards so
            that users’ paid services do not lapse because the payment
            instrument initially on file with Yahoo has expired (“Account
            Updater”). By buying a Flickr Service, you consent to Yahoo’s
            disclosure of your registration information to this third
            party service and to that service’s use of such information
            solely in connection with Account Updater. You also consent to
            Yahoo’s receipt and use of updated credit card or debit card
            account information from your financial institution in
            connection with the provision of the service as provided in
            the TOS, these Additional Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the
            Community Guidelines.
         3. Fraud Protections
            To protect against fraud, Yahoo may verify the credit card
            information you provide. The verification process may include
            debiting an amount between $0.00 and $1.00 from your credit
            card account and then immediately crediting the same amount
            back to your credit card. Yahoo will only use this process to
            screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card
            account except as part of a transaction conducted through your
            account for the Service. By providing Yahoo with your credit
            card information, you authorize Yahoo to debit and credit your
            credit card account for an amount less than or equal to one
            dollar for such verification purposes.
         4. Termination
            If your credit card is invalid for any reason, your account
            will revert to a free Flickr account and will be subject to
            the limitations of a free Flickr account; provided, however,
            that Yahoo reserves the right to cancel your account entirely
            in such case, whereupon all the information and content
            contained within it will be deleted permanently. Yahoo accepts
            no liability for data that is deleted due to an invalid credit
            card.
    5. AGE REQUIREMENTS
       The Flickr Services are available for individuals 13 or older. If
       you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review
       these terms and conditions with your parent or guardian to make
       sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to
       these terms and conditions.

THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY TO FLICKR GIFT PURCHASES
ONLY

    1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
       Welcome to Flickr Gift Certificate. By purchasing a Flickr Gift
       Certificate, you agree to these Gift Purchaser Terms at
       [26]https://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_purchaser.gne that supplement
       the Yahoo Terms of Service (“TOS”) at
       [27]https://www.flickr.com/utos_detect.gne (and any successor
       pages), which are incorporated by reference.
       Separate Terms of Service govern the redemption and use of the gift
       certificate and the use of the product by the recipient, and must
       be agreed by the recipient of a gift certificate prior to
       redemption of the gift certificate and use of the product. Those
       terms are at [28]https://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_redeemer.gne,
       and any successor pages. Yahoo reserves the right to update and
       change, from time to time, these Gift Purchaser Terms and all
       documents incorporated by reference. You can always find the most
       recent version of these Gift Purchaser Terms and the most recent
       version of the TOS at the URLs indicated above.
    2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
       Certain Flickr services allow the purchase of gift certificates, in
       which the cost of a subscription to that service may be given to
       another user as a gift. Flickr Gift Certificates can only be
       purchased on the Flickr site, and a particular gift certificate may
       only be applied toward the purchase of the Flickr service for which
       it is being offered.
       Gift certificates may be purchased in set amounts. Flickr Gift
       Certificates may not be used to purchase other Flickr Gift
       Certificates or any other Yahoo Services or Yahoo Gift
       Certificates.
    3. ELIGIBILITY
       A Flickr Gift Certificate may only be sold to persons 13 or older.
       Yahoo reserves the right to restrict the availability of a Flickr
       Gift Certificate to residents of certain U.S. states, with or
       without notice.
       A Flickr Gift Certificate is intended for use as a gift to an
       individual. A Flickr Gift Certificate is non-transferable, and
       resale of a Flickr Gift Certificate or use for unauthorized
       advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes
       is strictly prohibited. You agree that Yahoo has the right to
       suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or
       future use of gift certificates and balances (or any portion
       thereof) obtained or used under such circumstances.
    4. YAHOO ID REQUIREMENT
       In order to purchase a Flickr Gift Certificate, you must have a
       valid Yahoo ID. You provide your credit card, billing and shipping
       information and other information (“Registration Data”) to Yahoo,
       which will be stored. You agree that the Registration Data you
       provide is valid and complete and you will maintain and promptly
       update that information to keep it valid and complete. If you do
       not have a Yahoo ID, you will be prompted to register for one
       before you can pay for a Flickr Gift Certificate.
       You, and not Yahoo, are responsible for any and all purchases
       (including any unauthorized purchases or errors) made through Yahoo
       or in connection with your Yahoo ID. You must resolve
       purchase-related disputes with and promptly report unauthorized use
       of your credit card to your credit card company, online payment
       service provider, merchant, or bank. Your liability for
       unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your card issuer’s
       agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the
       uses of account information authorized by the TOS, Yahoo may
       access, preserve, monitor and disclose your card information in the
       good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to
       verify your account, to identify or resolve problems, or to respond
       to inquiries about any of your Flickr Services, but nothing in this
       section shall impose a duty on Yahoo to make any such disclosures.
    5. FEES AND CHARGES
       Flickr may, upon notice required by applicable laws, at any time:
       (i) change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fee or
       charge related to any Flickr Gift Certificate, or (ii) institute
       new fees or charges related to a Flickr Gift Certificate.
    6. NO REFUNDS
       Once your order is processed and confirmed by Yahoo, your gift
       certificate purchase is final. You will not be able to cancel your
       Flickr gift certificate order, and you will not be entitled to any
       refunds or credits.
    7. EXPIRATION
       A Flickr Gift Certificate does not expire. However, you understand
       and agree that receipt and acceptance of the Flickr Gift
       Certificate by your intended recipient will be deemed to have
       occurred when the recipient provides their consent to Yahoo to
       receive the gift or, in the case of a gift generating a gift code,
       when the recipient enters the gift code associated with the Flickr
       Gift Certificate on to the Flickr site and successfully applies the
       value associated with that gift to their Flickr account. In the
       unlikely event that your Flickr Gift Certificate is not received
       and accepted by your intended recipient twelve (12) months from the
       date that your payment for such gift certificate is finalized, then
       the Flickr Gift Certificate will be applied to your own Flickr
       account. By way of example and not limitation, if you purchase a
       one year Flickr Gift Certificate and the intended recipient of the
       Flickr Gift Certificate does not receive and accept the one year
       certificate twelve (12) months from the date of payment, one year
       of Pro status will be added to your own Flickr account. There are
       presently no service fees for the maintenance of unaccepted Flickr
       Gift Certificates.
    8. NO REPLACEMENT
       Flickr Gift Certificates will not be replaced if they are lost,
       stolen, or used without permission.
    9. TERMINATION
       Yahoo reserves the right to close customer accounts and request
       alternative forms of payment if a Flickr Gift Certificate is
       obtained or used fraudulently on the Flickr site.
   10. NO LIABILITY
       A Flickr Gift Certificate is provided “AS-IS”, and Yahoo assumes no
       responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery,
       misapplication or failure to store any user communications
       personalization settings, or balance.
