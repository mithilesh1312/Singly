Welcome to the Google Privacy Policy

   When you use Google services, you trust us with your information. This
   Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect,
   why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope
   you will take time to read it carefully. And remember, you can find
   controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and
   security at [26]My Account.

   There are many different ways you can use our services â€“ to search
   for and share information, to communicate with other people or to
   create new content. When you share information with us, for example by
   creating a [29]Google Account, we can make those services even better
   â€“ to show you [30]more relevant search results and ads, to help you
   [31]connect with people or to make [32]sharing with others quicker and
   easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how weâ€™re
   using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

   Our Privacy Policy explains:
     * What information we collect and why we collect it.
     * How we use that information.
     * The choices we offer, including how to access and update
       information.

   Weâ€™ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if youâ€™re not
   familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and
   browsers, then read about these [33]key terms first. Your privacy
   matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user,
   please do take the time to get to know our practices â€“ and if you
   have any questions [34]contact us.

Information we collect

   We collect information to provide better services to all of our users
   â€“ from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to
   more complex things like which [36]ads youâ€™ll find most useful,
   [37]the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos
   you might like.

   We collect information in the following ways:
     * Information you give us. For example, many of our services require
       you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, weâ€™ll ask for
       [38]personal information, like your name, email address, telephone
       number or [39]credit card to store with your account. If you want
       to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might
       also ask you to create a publicly visible [40]Google Profile, which
       may include your name and photo.
     * Information we get from your use of our services. We [41]collect
       information about the services that you use and how you use them,
       like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses
       our advertising services, or [42]view and interact with our ads and
       content. This information includes:
          + [43]Device information
            We collect [44]device-specific information (such as your
            hardware model, operating system version, [45]unique device
            identifiers, and mobile network information including phone
            number). Google may associate your [46]device identifiers or
            [47]phone number with your Google Account.
          + Log information
            When you use our services or view content provided by Google,
            we automatically collect and store certain information in
            [48]server logs. This includes:
               o details of how you used our service, such as your search
                 queries.
               o telephony log information like your phone number,
                 calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date
                 of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and
                 types of calls.
               o [49]Internet protocol address.
               o device event information such as crashes, system
                 activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser
                 language, the date and time of your request and referral
                 URL.
               o cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your
                 Google Account.
          + Location information
            When you use Google services, we [50]may collect and process
            information about your actual location. We use various
            technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS,
            [51]and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google
            with information on nearby devices, [52]Wi-Fi access points
            and cell towers.
          + Unique application numbers
            Certain services include a unique application number. This
            number and information about your installation (for example,
            the operating system type and application version number) may
            be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service
            or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such
            as for automatic updates.
          + Local storage
            We may collect and store information (including personal
            information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as
            [53]browser web storage (including HTML 5) and [54]application
            data caches.
          + Cookies and similar technologies
            We [55]and our partners use various technologies to collect
            and store information when you visit a Google service, and
            this may include using [56]cookies or similar technologies to
            identify your browser or device. We also use these
            technologies to collect and store information when you
            interact with services we offer to our partners, such as
            [57]advertising services or Google features that may appear on
            other sites. Our Google Analytics product helps businesses and
            site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps.
            When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such
            as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics
            information is [58]linked, by the Google Analytics customer or
            by Google, using Google technology, with information about
            visits to multiple sites.

   Information we collect when you are signed in to Google may be
   associated with your Google Account. When information is associated
   with your Google Account, we treat it as personal information. For more
   information about how you can access, manage or delete information that
   is associated with your Google Account, visit the [59]Transparency and
   choice section of this policy.
   [60]Back to top

How we use information we collect

   We use the information we collect from all of our services to
   [61]provide, [62]maintain, [63]protect and improve them, to [64]develop
   new ones, and to [65]protect Google and our users. We also use this
   information to offer you tailored content â€“ like giving you more
   relevant search results and ads.

   We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of
   the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we
   may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you
   are represented consistently across all our services. If other users
   already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we
   may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as
   your name and photo.

   If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile
   photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications
   connected to your Google Account (such as +1â€™s, reviews you write and
   comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and
   other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to
   [66]limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account.

   When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help
   solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to
   inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming
   changes or improvements.

   We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like
   [67]pixel tags, to [68]improve your user experience and the overall
   quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our
   own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language
   preferences, weâ€™ll be able to have our services appear in the
   language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not
   associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with
   [69]sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual
   orientation or health.

   Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to
   provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized
   search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.

   We may [70]combine personal information from one service with
   information, including personal information, from other Google services
   â€“ for example [71]to make it easier to share things with people you
   know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with
   personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.

   We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose
   other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.

   Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries
   around the world. We may process your personal information on a server
   located outside the country where you live.
   [72]Back to top

Transparency and choice

   People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about
   what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices
   about how it is used. For example, you can:
     * [73]Visit your Google Account History for settings that allow you
       to control the collection of personal information from Google
       services, such as Search, YouTube and Location History.
     * [74]Review and control certain types of information tied to your
       Google Account by using Google Dashboard.
     * [75]View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to
       you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might
       interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain
       Google advertising services here.
     * [76]Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account
       appears to others.
     * [77]Control who you share information with through your Google
       Account.
     * [78]Take information associated with your Google Account out of
       many of our services.
     * [79]Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in
       shared endorsements that appear in ads.

   You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies
   associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set
   by us. However, itâ€™s important to remember that many of our services
   [80]may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For
   example, we may not remember your language preferences.
   [81]Back to top

Information you share

   Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember
   that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search
   engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different
   options on [82]sharing and [83]removing your content.
   [84]Back to top

Accessing and updating your personal information

   Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with [85]access to
   your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to
   give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it â€“ unless we have
   to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.
   When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your
   identity before we can act on your request.

   We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require
   disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system
   or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of
   others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
   concerning information residing on backup systems).

   Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so
   for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We
   aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from
   accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete
   information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual
   copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our
   backup systems.
   [86]Back to top

Information we share

   We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and
   individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances
   applies:
     * With your consent
       We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
       individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so.
       We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any [87]sensitive
       personal information.
     * With domain administrators
       If your Google Account is managed for you by a [88]domain
       administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain
       administrator and resellers who provide user support to your
       organization will have access to your Google Account information
       (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator
       may be able to:
          + view statistics regarding your account, like statistics
            regarding applications you install.
          + change your account password.
          + suspend or terminate your account access.
          + access or retain information stored as part of your account.
          + receive your account information in order to satisfy
            applicable law, regulation, [89]legal process or enforceable
            governmental request.
          + restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy
            settings.
       Please refer to your domain administratorâ€™s privacy policy for
       more information.
     * For external processing
       We provide personal information to our [90]affiliates or other
       trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our
       instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any
       other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
     * For legal reasons
       We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
       individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that
       access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is
       reasonably necessary to:
          + meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
            enforceable governmental request.
          + enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation
            of potential violations.
          + detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or
            technical issues.
          + protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of
            Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by
            law.

   [91]We may share aggregated, [92]non-personally identifiable
   information publicly and with our partners â€“ like publishers,
   advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information
   publicly [93]to show trends about the general use of our services.

   If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will
   continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and
   give affected users notice before personal information is transferred
   or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
   [94]Back to top

Information security

   We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access
   to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information
   we hold. In particular:
     * We encrypt many of our services [95]using SSL.
     * We offer you [96]two step verification when you access your Google
       Account, and a [97]Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.
     * We review our information collection, storage and processing
       practices, including physical security measures, to guard against
       unauthorized access to systems.
     * We restrict access to personal information to Google employees,
       contractors and agents who need to know that information in order
       to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual
       confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if
       they fail to meet these obligations.

When this Privacy Policy applies

   Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google
   Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, and services offered on
   other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services
   that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this
   Privacy Policy.

   Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other
   companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be
   displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google
   services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy
   does not cover the information practices of other companies and
   organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies,
   pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
   [99]Back to top

Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities

   We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also
   adhere to several [100]self regulatory frameworks. When we receive
   formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the
   complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory
   authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve
   any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot
   resolve with our users directly.
   [101]Back to top

Changes

   Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce
   your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We
   will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes
   are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including,
   for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We
   will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for
   your review.

   to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google
   makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you
   start to type in their name.

Example

"view and interact with our ads"

   For example, we regularly report to advertisers on whether we served
   their ad to a page and whether that ad was likely to be seen by users
   (as opposed to, for example, being on part of the page to which users
   did not scroll).
