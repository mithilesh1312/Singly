   12. MISCELLANEOUS – Unless the parties have entered into a written
   amendment to this agreement that is signed by both parties regarding
   the Foursquare API, this Agreement and the Foursquare Platform Policy
   constitute the entire agreement between Licensee and Foursquare
   pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all
   written or oral agreements with respect to such subject matter. This
   Agreement, and any disputes arising from or relating to the
   interpretation thereof, shall be governed by and construed under New
   York law as such law applies to agreements between New York residents
   entered into and to be performed within New York by two residents
   thereof and without reference to its conflict of laws principles or the
   United Nations Conventions for the International Sale of Goods. Except
   to the extent otherwise determined by Foursquare, any action or
   proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement must be brought
   in a federal court in the Southern District of New York or in state
   court in New York County, New York, and each party irrevocably submits
   to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or
   proceeding. The prevailing party in any action arising out of this
   Agreement shall be entitled to an award of its costs and attorneys'
   fees. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by
   Foursquare. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
   unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to
   the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The failure of Foursquare
   to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Licensee or others
   does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit Foursquare's rights
   with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. This Agreement
   is personal to Licensee and may not be assigned or transferred for any
   reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law,
   merger, reorganization, or as a result of an acquisition or change of
   control involving Licensee) without Foursquare's prior written consent
   and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void
   and without effect. Foursquare expressly reserves the right to assign
   this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.
