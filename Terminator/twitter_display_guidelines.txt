Introduction

   The power of Twitter is in the network of people using it, and its
   ability to bring users closer to what’s most meaningful to them. When
   we first launched, Tweets were a simple 140 character update. However,
   as Twitter evolved, so too has the way that users view and interact
   with Tweets.
   Today’s Tweets are rich living conversations: a user can give feedback
   to the author, participate in the conversation, and spread the word.
   For that to happen, Tweets must be shown in a way that meets the user’s
   expectation - whether on a mobile phone, on a web site, in a desktop
   application, or anywhere else.
   Developing the following set of Display Requirements allows Tweets to
   remain connected to every user on Twitter. For example, if Tweet
   actions aren’t enabled, a Tweet can’t be replied to or reach more users
   with Retweets. If @usernames and avatars aren’t linked to profiles,
   users can’t learn more about or easily follow that interesting Twitter
   account. It’s also worth noting that we have embeddable Tweets and
   embeddable timelines available, which will take care of these Display
   Requirements for you.
   Lastly, we’re committed to bringing the power and interactivity of the
   Twitter network to all platforms, and we will continue to evolve the
   user experience within Tweets and timelines. This is a living document,
   so please check back from time to time for updates.
   Effective date: October 5th, 2012
   Last update date: September 5th, 2012

Individual Tweet

   Above: Examples for rendering details of Individual Tweets on websites
                              and mobile apps.

    1. Tweet Author
         1. The Tweet author’s avatar must always be displayed, unless
            your application is displaying Tweets on a mobile platform
            that has clear physical or technical limitations (e.g.,
            low-end feature phones).
         2. The @username must always be displayed with the “@” symbol.
         3. The author’s name and @username must be displayed to the right
            of the avatar either on one line horizontally or stacked one
            above the other vertically, with the name first.
         4. The avatar, name, and @username must all link to the user’s
            Twitter profile.
    2. Tweet Text
         1. Tweet text must be displayed on a line below the author’s name
            and @username, and may not be altered or modified in any way
            except as outlined in these requirements.
         2. [21]Tweet Entities within the Tweet text must be properly
            linked to their appropriate home on Twitter. For example:
              1. User_mentions must link to the mentioned user’s profile.
              2. Hashtags must link to a twitter.com search with the
                 hashtag as the query.
              3. Links in Tweet text must be displayed using the
                 display_url field in the URL entities API response, and
                 link to the original t.co url field.
    3. Tweet Actions
         1. Reply, Retweet, and Favorite action icons must always be
            visible for the user to interact with the Tweet. These actions
            must be implemented using [22]Web Intents or with the
            authenticated Twitter API.
         2. No other social or 3rd party actions similar to Follow, Reply,
            Retweet and Favorite may be attached to a Tweet.
    4. Tweet Timestamp
         1. The Tweet timestamp must always be visible and include the
            time and date. e.g., “3:00 PM - 31 May 12”.
    5. Tweet Permalink
         1. The Tweet timestamp must always be linked to the Tweet
            permalink.
    6. Branding
         1. It must always be clear to the viewing user that they are
            looking at a Tweet, and that the content is from Twitter.
         2. [23]The Twitter logo or [24]Follow button for the Tweet author
            must always be displayed.
         3. The Twitter logo must link to Twitter.
       For linking Tweet authors (1d), Tweet entities (2b), Tweet
       permalinks (5a) and the Twitter Logo (6c), please see “Linking to
       Twitter” below for additional guidance.
    Timelines In addition to the above Individual Tweet Display
       Requirements, a few modifications to the Tweet anatomy are required
       when displaying as part of a timeline:

      Above: Examples for rendering a timeline of Individual Tweets on
                          websites and mobile apps.
         1. Tweet Author
              1. The author’s name and @username should be displayed on
                 one line horizontally or stacked one above the other
                 vertically, with the name first.
              2. The @username must always be displayed with the “@”
                 symbol.
              3. The avatar must be positioned to the left of the name,
                 @username, and Tweet text.
         2. Tweet Actions
              1. Reply, Retweet and Favorite Tweet actions must always be
                 available to the user when interacting with the Tweet on
                 the timeline. e.g., select, hover, touch, swipe.
              2. For applications on mobile platforms, you may choose to
                 link the entire Tweet area to the Individual Tweet within
                 your app or on Twitter to provide users access to Tweet
                 actions.
         3. Tweet Timestamps
              1. Tweet timestamp should be displayed in the top right
                 corner.
              2. For Tweets that have been sent in the last 24 hours, use
                 the short form timestamp relative to the current time,
                 for example “20s” for a Tweet sent 20 seconds ago, “3m”
                 for 3 minutes ago, “5h” for 5 hours ago.
              3. Tweets older than 24 hours should show a short form date
                 including the day and month, e.g., “6 Jun”.
         4. Tweet Permalink
              1. The Tweet timestamp must always be linked to the Tweet
                 permalink.
              2. For applications on mobile platforms, you may choose to
                 link the entire Tweet area to the Tweet permalink.
         5. Retweet Indicator
              1. If the Tweet being displayed is a Retweet, the name of
                 the user who Retweeted it and the Retweet icon must be
                 displayed under the Tweet text. e.g., “Retweeted by Josh
                 Brewer”. The name should link to the the Retweeting
                 user’s profile, unless your application is displaying
                 Tweets on a mobile platform that has clear physical or
                 technical limitations.
         6. Timeline Integrity
              1. Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline must not
                 be rendered with non-Twitter content. e.g., comments,
                 updates from other networks.
         7. Branding
              1. It must always be clear to the viewing user that they are
                 looking at a Twitter timeline, and that the content is
                 from Twitter.
              2. [25]The Twitter logo must always be displayed directly
                 adjacent to the timeline (e.g., top of the timeline).
            All timelines must allow users to view details of an
            Individual Tweet with the requirements above. However, if
            displaying Individual Tweets on a mobile platform has clear
            physical or technical limitations that prevents meeting these
            requirements, you must direct users to twitter.com or a
            official Twitter mobile client to display the details of an
            Individual Tweet.
            For linking to Tweet actions (2b), Tweet permalinks (4a, 4b)
            and Retweet user (5a), please see “Linking to Twitter” below
            for additional guidance.

Linking to Twitter
            When linking from an avatar, name, @username, Tweet entity,
            Tweet action, Tweet permalink or the Twitter logo, you must
            use one of the methods below when linking:
              1. Link directly to the correct twitter.com URL e.g.,
                 [26]https://twitter.com/jack/statuses/20
              2. Use [27]Web Intents
            However, for linking an avatar, name, and @username, hashtag,
            you may also choose to link to an internal representation
            within your application. However, this internal representation
            must have a link back to the core experience on twitter.com or
            an official Twitter client in some manner.
            Applications that cannot implement these guidelines due to the
            technical limitations of their platform should make a best
            effort to satisfy as many rules as possible. Exceptions will
            be made on a case by case basis by email approval. Please
            contact [28]trademarks@twitter.com if you feel that an
            exception is necessary.
