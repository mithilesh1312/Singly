Display Guidelines

Introduction

   Users must have a consistent experience wherever they interact with
   Tweets, whether on Twitter.com, a mobile client, website, or in an
   application developed with the Twitter API. To ensure consistency
   across the platform and ecosystem, we’ve put together the following
   Display Guidelines for developers to implement when creating
   experiences with Tweets and Timelines.

Individual Tweet

    1. Tweet Author
         1. The Tweet author’s avatar must always be displayed.
         2. The author’s name and @username must be displayed next to the
            avatar.
         3. The @username must always be displayed with the “@” symbol.
         4. The avatar, name, and @username must all link to the user’s
            Twitter profile [1].
    2. Tweet Text
         1. Tweet text must be displayed on a line below the author’s name
            and @username, and may not be altered or modified in any way.
         2. [19]Entities within the Tweet text must be properly linked to
            their appropriate home on Twitter.com:
              1. @mentions must link to the mentioned user’s profile [1].
              2. #hashtags must link to a twitter.com search with the
                 hashtag as the query. e.g. #flora must be linked to
                 [20]https://twitter.com/search/%23flora
              3. Links in Tweet text must be displayed using the
                 display_url field in the URL entities API response, and
                 link to the original t.co url field.
    3. Tweet Actions
         1. Reply, Retweet, and Favorite action icons must always be
            visible for the user to interact with the Tweet. These actions
            must be implemented using [21]Web Intents or with the
            authenticated Twitter API.
         2. No other social or 3rd party actions may be attached to a
            Tweet.
    4. Timestamp and Permalink
         1. The Tweet timestamp must always be visible and include the
            time and date. e.g. “3:00 PM - 31 May 12”.
         2. The Tweet timestamp must always be linked to the Tweet
            permalink page on twitter.com. e.g.
            [22]https://twitter.com/jack/statuses/20
    5. Branding
         1. It must always be clear to the viewing user that they are
            looking at a Tweet, and that the content is from Twitter.
         2. [23]The Twitter logo or [24]Follow button for the Tweet author
            must always be displayed in the top right corner.
    6. Images and Media
         1. pic.twitter.com images available in the [25]Tweet entities
            must be displayed as part of the Tweet, and must link back to
            the Tweet permalink page.
         2. pic.twitter.com images may not be detached and displayed
            separately from the Tweet.

Timelines

   In addition to the above Tweet display guidelines, a few modifications
   to the Tweet anatomy are required when displaying as part of a
   timeline:

    1. Tweet Author
         1. The user’s name and @username should be displayed on one line,
            with the name first.
         2. The avatar must be positioned to the left of the name,
            @username, and Tweet text.
    2. Timestamps
         1. Tweet timestamp should be displayed in the top right corner.
         2. For Tweets that have been sent in the last 24 hours, use the
            short form timestamp, for example “20s” for a Tweet sent 20
            seconds ago, “3m” for 3 minutes ago, “5h” for 5 hours ago.
         3. Tweets older than 24 hours should show a short form date
            including the day and month, e.g. “6 Jun”.
    3. Tweet Actions
         1. Reply, Retweet and Favorite Tweet action icons must always be
            available to the user when interacting with the Tweet on the
            timeline. e.g. hover, touch.
    4. Retweets
         1. If the Tweet being displayed is a Retweet, the name of the
            user who Retweeted it and the Retweet icon must be displayed
            under the Tweet text. e.g. “Retweeted by Josh Brewer”. The
            name should link to the the Retweeting user’s profile [1].
    5. Timeline Integrity
         1. Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline should not be
            rendered with non-Twitter content. e.g. comments, updates from
            other networks.

Footnotes

    1. Linking the @username to a Twitter profile:
         1. You must use one of the methods below when linking from an
            avatar, name, and @username:
              1. Link directly to the user’s profile page on twitter.com.
                 e.g. [26]https://twitter.com/jack
              2. Use a [27]Web Intent to the user’s profile.
              3. Link to an internal profile for the user within your app.
                 That profile must have a link back to the user’s profile
                 page on Twitter.com.

   Applications that cannot implement these guidelines due to the
   technical limitations of their platform should make a best effort to
   satisfy as many rules as possible. Exceptions will be made on a case by
   case basis by email approval. Please contact [28]trademarks@twitter.com
   if you feel that an exception is necessary.
