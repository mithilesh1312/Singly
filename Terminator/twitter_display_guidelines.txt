   The Anatomy of a Tweet

Requirements

    1. Tweet Author: The author's name should be presented as the author's
       Twitter username or name with the username present. The name should
       be linked to the user's Twitter profile page at
       http://twitter.com/username, made actionable using a [15]Web
       Intent, or linked within your service's internal representation of
       the author's profile, which should contain a link to the user's
       Twitter profile page. The author's username should be styled
       differently than the Tweet text and links (bold, color, size, or
       other typographic convention), and should not be preceded by an @
       symbol.
    2. @mentions: Mentions of other Twitter usernames must link to the
       profile page at http://twitter.com/username, made actionable using
       a [16]Web Intent, or linked within your service's internal
       representation of the user's profile, which should contain a link
       to the username's Twitter profile page.
    3. Hashtags: If any hashtags ('#' followed by a string of characters)
       are mentioned in the Tweet, they must link to a twitter.com search
       results page for that query term (for example,
       http://twitter.com/search?q=%23newtwitter). If your service is a
       "Client", then an internal representation of the results containing
       a link to the Twitter search page is also acceptable. A "Client" is
       an application that provides major components of a Twitter-like end
       user experience. Please see our [17]API Terms of Service for more
       information on this.
    4. URLs: If any URLs are included in the Tweet, they must be
       hyperlinked and the hyperlink must link to the location passed
       through the API. Hyperlinked URLs are best displayed when visually
       differentiated (colors or underline).
    5. Branding: If one Tweet is displayed independently, it must be
       labeled with either the Twitter wordmark or the Twitter Bird
       (consult our [18]Image Resources), or with text reading "Content
       from Twitter." If multiple Tweets are grouped, the Twitter wordmark
       or "Content from Twitter" must be placed in a close proximity to
       the grouped content.
    6. Tweet Box: If showing a box for users to Tweet from, "What's
       Happening?" should be written above the text field. This Tweet box
       should also either be near Tweets that include the Twitter wordmark
       or the Twitter Bird, or the Twitter wordmark or the Twitter Bird
       should be present within the box.
         a. Tweet button: The button should be displayed and labeled as
            "Tweet" if the content is being posted exclusively to Twitter,
            or "Update" if directing to other services in addition to
            Twitter.
         b. Character count: A character count helps users counts down to
            stay within 140 characters
    7. Images: If displaying images posted via Twitter, always display the
       image and its associated Tweet together. The Tweet must include the
       full text, the author's username or name with the username present,
       and should be linked to the author's Twitter profile page at
       http://twitter.com/username. Clicking on the image should
       ultimately open the image url contained in the Tweet.
         a. The Tweet text may be displayed beneath the associated image,
            much like a caption.
         b. If it is not possible to display the full Tweet along with the
            image (for example because the image is being displayed as a
            thumbnail), make the image clickable to a view where it is
            clearly associated with the Tweet that mentions it.

   Exceptions to the above will be made on a case by case basis by email
   approval. Please contact [19]trademarks@twitter.com if you feel that an
   exception is necessary.

Suggestions

   The following are suggestions based on how Tweets look on Twitter. You
   may find that this isn't the most relevant way to display the data you
   show, and we encourage your creativity. However, if you're looking for
   some direction, please see the following:
    A. Avatar & Alignment: We show the user's avatar on the left side of
       the Tweet. Remaining Tweet content is aligned‐left, immediately to
       the right of the avatar. The avatar links the user's Twitter
       profile page at http://twitter.com/username.
    B. Timestamp and Permalink: This information can be shown either
       relative, e.g. "2 minutes ago", or absolute, e.g. "8:45 AM, Jul
       8th"). The timestamp should be on its own line after the Tweet text
       and styled differently to be less prominent than the Tweet text
       (lighter color and/or smaller size). The timestamp should also link
       to the Twitter hosted permalink page for the individual Tweet.
    C. Tweet Actions: Reply, Retweet, and Favorite actions should always
       be available from a Tweet, and should be displayed with their
       respective action icons. They should be arranged left to right as
       Reply, Retweet, Favorite. Easily accomplish this by utilizing
       [20]Web Intents.
    D. Source: Along with the timestamp and permalink, you may choose to
       display the client or means by which the Tweet was posted (e.g.
       "from web" or "from Twitter for iPhone"). If client is supplied,
       please make sure it links to the source page URL provided.
    E. Multiple Tweets: If showing multiple Tweets at once, they can be
       visually separated by horizontal lines, empty spaces, or alternate
       background colors. The empty space should be proportional to the
       overall height of the Tweet itself.
    F. Multiple Tweets, One Author: We find that when showing multiple
       Tweets from the same user, it looks best if the profile picture is
       not repeated with each Tweet. Showing one avatar with content from
       the same user provides for a simpler experience.
    G. Chronological order: It usually makes sense for Tweets to be
       ordered in reverse chronological order (latest first), but we
       understand that this might not always be the most relevant way to
       arrange Tweets. When shown as search results or other criteria
       (keyword, user, or other editorial constraints) Tweets may be
       ordered by those criteria.
    H. Name with Username: If the full name is displayed alongside the
       Twitter username, the Twitter username should be visually
       differentiated (e.g. color or bold) and more prominent.
    I. Search Link: Information becomes more discoverable when a search
       term links to a Twitter search results page. If you have a product
       that returns search results for Tweets, we recommend that the term
       links back to the relevant search page within Twitter.
