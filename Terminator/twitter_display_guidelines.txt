Introduction

   The power of Twitter is in the network of people using it, and its
   ability to bring users closer to what's most meaningful to them. When
   we first launched, Tweets were simple 140 character updates. However,
   as Twitter evolved, so too has the way that users view and interact
   with Tweets.
   Today's Tweets are rich living conversations: users can give real-time
   feedback to authors, participate in lively debates, and spread a
   message across the world. Photos, video and other media types add color
   and provide deep context to create some of the most engaging moments on
   Twitter. For users to enjoy these aspects of our service, Tweets must
   always be shown in a way that meets the user's expectation - whether on
   a mobile phone, on a web site, in a desktop application, or anywhere
   else.
   To help ensure every Tweet is displayed optimally and connected to
   every user on Twitter, we encourage using [23]Embedded Tweets and
   [24]Embedded Timelines. When using these products to publish Twitter
   content onto your web or mobile property, Tweets and timelines are
   automatically rendered with all our Display Requirements.
   However, if using our embeds is not possible, you must follow the
   Display Requirements below when displaying Tweets and timelines on your
   own. If we did not have these rules, Tweets may not perform or enable
   interactions that users expect.  For example, if Tweet actions aren't
   enabled, a Tweet can't be replied to or reach more users with Retweets.
   If @usernames and avatars aren't linked to profiles, users can't learn
   more about or easily follow that interesting Twitter account.
   We're committed to bringing the power and interactivity of the Twitter
   network to all platforms, and we will continue to evolve the user
   experience within Tweets and timelines. This is a living document, so
   please check back from time to time for updates.
   Lastly, please keep in mind that these requirements apply only to
   online mediums. For broadcast, offline, or other static displays of
   Tweets, please review our [25]other content display guidelines.
   Last update date: July 02, 2013

Individual Tweet

   Above: Examples for rendering details of Individual Tweets on websites
                              and mobile apps.

    1. Tweet Author
         1. The Tweet author's avatar, @username, and name must always be
            displayed (unless your application displays Tweets on a mobile
            platform that has clear physical or technical limitations,
            e.g., low-end feature phones may not be able to display
            avatars).
         2. The Tweet author's @username must always be displayed with the
            "@" symbol.
         3. The Tweet author's name and @username must be displayed on one
            line horizontally or stacked one above the other vertically.
         4. The Tweet author's avatar must be positioned to the left of
            the author's name and @username  - except for Tweets in
            languages that read right to left, in which case the author's
            avatar must be position to the right of the author's name and
            @username.
         5. The Tweet author's avatar, name, and @username must all link
            to the user's Twitter profile.
    2. Tweet Text
         1. Tweet text must be displayed on a line below the author's name
            and @username, and may not be altered or modified in any way
            except as outlined in these requirements.
         2. [26]Tweet Entities within the Tweet text must be properly
            linked to their appropriate home on Twitter. For example:
              1. User_mentions must link to the mentioned user's profile.
              2. Hashtags must link to a Twitter search with the hashtag
                 as the query.
              3. Links in Tweet text must be displayed using the
                 display_url field in the URL entities API response, and
                 link to the original t.co url field. See our [27]t.co
                 best practices article for additional details.
    3. Tweet Actions
         1. Reply, Retweet, and Favorite action icons must always be
            visible for the user to interact with the Tweet. These actions
            must be implemented using [28]Web Intents or with the
            authenticated Twitter API. (To support the implementation of
            Tweet Actions, we provide several [29]image resources for
            developers to leverage.)
         2. No other social or 3rd party actions similar to Follow, Reply,
            Retweet and Favorite may be attached to a Tweet. (e.g.,
            subscribe, comment, like).
    4. Tweet Timestamp
         1. The Tweet timestamp must always be visible and include the
            date and/or time.
    5. Tweet Permalink
         1. The Tweet timestamp must always be linked to the Tweet
            permalink.
    6. Branding
         1. [30]The Twitter logo or [31]Follow button for the Tweet author
            must always be displayed and be reasonably visible.
         2. The Twitter logo must link to twitter.com or to an official
            Twitter client.
       For linking Tweet authors (1d), Tweet entities (2b), Tweet
       permalinks (5a) and the Twitter Logo (6b), please see "Linking to
       Twitter" below for additional guidance.
       Timelines

      Above: Examples for rendering a timeline of Individual Tweets on
                          websites and mobile apps.
       Tweets displayed as part of a timeline are subject to the following
       additional requirements:
         1. Tweet Author
              1. The avatar must be positioned to the left of the Tweet
                 text, author's name, and @username - except for Tweets in
                 languages that read right to left, in which case the
                 author's avatar must be position to the right of the
                 Tweet text, author's name and @username.
         2. Tweet Actions
              1. Although Reply, Retweet and Favorite Tweet actions must
                 always be available to the user when interacting with the
                 Tweet in a timeline (e.g., select, hover, touch, swipe),
                 they do not need to be visible initially.
              2. For applications on mobile platforms, you may provide
                 users access to Tweet actions by linking the entire Tweet
                 area to the Individual Tweet within your app or on
                 Twitter.
         3. Tweet Timestamps
              1. For Tweets that have been sent in the last 24 hours, use
                 the short form timestamp relative to the current time,
                 for example "20s" for a Tweet sent 20 seconds ago, "3m"
                 for 3 minutes ago, "5h" for 5 hours ago.
              2. Tweets older than 24 hours should show a short form date
                 including the day and month, e.g., "6 Jun".
         4. Retweet Indicator
              1. If the Tweet being displayed is a Retweet, the name of
                 the user who Retweeted it and the Retweet icon must be
                 displayed above or under the Tweet text. e.g., "Retweeted
                 by Josh Brewer". The name must link to the Retweeting
                 user's profile, unless your application is displaying
                 Tweets on a mobile platform that has clear physical or
                 technical limitations.
         5. Timeline Integrity
              1. Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline must not
                 be rendered with non-Twitter content (e.g., comments,
                 updates from other networks). However, this does not
                 apply to timelines where Tweets are explicitly selected
                 by an end-user to appear next to non-Twitter content
                 (e.g., manually authored live blogs, manually curated
                 media collections, or commenting systems).
         6. Branding
              1. Instead of displaying the Twitter logo for each Tweet,
                 [32]the Twitter logo must always be displayed directly
                 attached to the timeline (e.g., top of the timeline) and
                 be reasonably visible.
         7. Individual Tweet Link
              1. All timelines must allow users to view details of an
                 Individual Tweet (e.g., by linking the Tweet timestamp or
                 by linking the entire Tweet area), either via your
                 representation of an Individual Tweet or via the
                 Individual Tweet on an official Twitter client (including
                 twitter.com).
            All timelines must allow users to view details of an
            Individual Tweet with the requirements above. However, if
            displaying Individual Tweets on a mobile platform has clear
            physical or technical limitations that prevents meeting these
            requirements, you must direct users to twitter.com or a
            official Twitter mobile client to display the details of an
            Individual Tweet.
            For linking to Tweet actions (2b) and Retweeting user (5a),
            please see "Linking to Twitter" below for additional guidance.

Linking to Twitter
            When linking from an avatar, name, @username, Tweet entity,
            Tweet action, Tweet permalink or the Twitter logo, you must
            use one of the methods below when linking:
              1. Link directly to the correct twitter.com URL e.g.,
                 [33]https://twitter.com/jack/statuses/20
              2. Use [34]Web Intents
            However, for linking an avatar, name, @username, and hashtag,
            you may also choose to link to an internal representation
            within your application. However, this internal representation
            must have a link back to the core experience on twitter.com or
            an official Twitter client in some manner.

Technical Limitations
            Applications that cannot implement these guidelines due to the
            technical limitations of their platform must make a best
            effort to satisfy as many rules as possible. Exceptions will
            be made on a case by case basis by email approval. Please
            contact us through our [35]platform policy support forms if
            you feel that an exception is necessary.
