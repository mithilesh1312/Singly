API Terms of Service

   LAST UPDATED DECEMBER 9, 2014

   The Fitbit API (the "API") is provided as an asset to community members
   and partners to facilitate innovation in health, wellness and tracking
   applications. It is designed to interact with and enhance the Fitbit
   Tracker and the Fitbit user platform.

   While we try to provide the most open and flexible access we can, we
   aim to support a balance between developers' needs, users' privacy, and
   the integrity of Fitbit's product and business vision. To that end, we
   anticipate that the Fitbit Platform, our API and these Terms of Service
   will evolve over time. We will update these Terms of Service as needed
   or required and will always post such updates here.

   If there is a use case you would like to see covered that is not
   currently supported by the API or these Terms of Service, please
   contact us at [26]api@fitbit.com to discuss your needs. Additionally,
   please participate in the Fitbit API developer group, which can be
   found [27]here.

1. Certain definitions

   "Application(s)" means applications developed by you that interact with
   the Fitbit Platform.

   "Customer Data" means any data collected by users of your Developer
   Application, including but not limited to the names, addresses, URL's,
   or e-mail addresses of any Fitbit customer.

   "Fitbit Data" means the user data collected from the Fitbit Tracker and
   made available to you through the API.

   "Fitbit User Interface" means the Fitbit user interface, currently
   located at www.fitbit.com.

   "Fitbit Platform" means the Fitbit API, the Fitbit Data and the Fitbit
   User Interface.

   "User" means a registered user of your application.

   "User Data" means that subset of the Fitbit Data that is associated
   with a User.

2. Data access, Restrictions & policies

    a. You may use the API to develop Applications designed to interact
       with and enhance the Fitbit Platform or for data backup purposes.
    b. All access to and use of API, the Fitbit Data and/or the Fitbit
       User Interface, and any documentation or other assets provided to
       you by Fitbit shall be governed by these Terms of Service, in
       addition to the Fitbit Terms of Use
    c. The API is made available for the purposes of extending and
       improving the Fitbit product experience, and the API should not be
       used to create services that replace the Fitbit Platform.
    d. You may use the API to retrieve or post Fitbit Data, subscribe to
       User Data-feeds and render and display information in external
       applications according to these Terms of Service.
    e. Fitbit Data may be used solely as necessary to provide your
       Application to end users. You may make no further use of the Fitbit
       Data without express User consent.
    f. Use of the API is subject to restrictions on rate limit, use types
       and method calls as outlined on the Fitbit Developer Portal. If
       Fitbit reasonably believes that you have exceeded your rate limits
       or have attempted to circumvent the rate limit or authentication
       systems, your ability to utilize the API may be temporarily
       suspended or permanently revoked. Fitbit may monitor your usage of
       the API in order to improve our service and to ensure compliance
       with our policies.
    g. You will not attempt or encourage others to:
          + Re-sell, re-license or syndicate access to the API to third
            parties in a way that bypasses said third parties requirements
            to register with Fitbit for API access;
          + Perform wholesale export of Fitbit Data for the purpose of
            account migration or service duplication;
          + Render Fitbit Data within another product without complying
            with the display guidelines outlined below;
          + Use the API for purposes of publishing known bad data into the
            Fitbit system.
          + Use or access the API for the purpose of monitoring the
            performance or functionality of the Fitbit Platform or for any
            other benchmarking or competitive purposes.

   If you are unsure whether your intended use of the API is in compliance
   with these Terms of Service, please contact us at [28]api@fitbit.com to
   discuss. Additionally, please participate in the Fitbit API Developer
   Forum located [29]here.
