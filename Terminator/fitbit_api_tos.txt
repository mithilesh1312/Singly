API Terms of Service

   These Terms of Service were last updated on March 24, 2011

   The Fitbit API (the “API”) is provided as an asset to community members
   and partners to facilitate innovation in health, wellness and tracking
   applications. It is designed to interact with and enhance the Fitbit
   Tracker and the Fitbit user platform.

   While we try to provide the most open and flexible access we can, we
   aim to support a balance between developers' needs, users' privacy, and
   the integrity of Fitbit's product and business vision. To that end, we
   anticipate that the Fitbit Platform, our API and these Terms of Service
   will evolve over time. We will update these Terms of Service as needed
   or required and will always post such updates here.

   If there is a use case you would like to see covered that is not
   currently supported by the API or these Terms of Service, please
   contact us at api@fitbit.com to discuss your needs. Additionally,
   please participate in the Fitbit API developer group, which can be
   found [9]here.

Certain Definitions

   “Fitbit Data” means the user data collected from the Fitbit Tracker and
   made available to you through the API.

   “Fitbit User Interface” means the Fitbit user interface, currently
   located at [10]www.fitbit.com.

   “Fitbit Platform” means the Fitbit API, the Fitbit Data and the Fitbit
   User Interface.

   “User” means a registered user of your application.

   “User Data” means that subset of the Fitbit Data that is associated
   with a User.

Data Access, Restrictions & Policies

    1. You may use the API to develop web, desktop or mobile applications
       (each an “Application”) designed to interact with and enhance the
       Fitbit Platform or for data backup purposes.
    2. All access to and use of API, the Fitbit Data and/or the Fitbit
       User Interface, and any documentation or other assets provided to
       you by Fitbit shall be governed by these Terms of Service, in
       addition to the [11]Fitbit Terms of Use
    3. The API is made available for the purposes of extending and
       improving the Fitbit product experience, and the API should not be
       used to create services that replace the Fitbit Platform.
    4. You may use the API to retrieve or post Fitbit Data, subscribe to
       User Data-feeds and render and display information in external
       applications according to these Terms of Service.
    5. Fitbit Data may be used solely as necessary to provide your
       Application to end users. You may make no further use of the Fitbit
       Data without express User consent.
    6. Use of the API is subject to restrictions on rate limit, use types
       and method calls as outlined on the Fitbit Developer Portal. If
       Fitbit reasonably believes that you have exceeded your rate limits
       or have attempted to circumvent the rate limit or authentication
       systems, your ability to utilize the API may be temporarily
       suspended or permanently revoked. Fitbit may monitor your usage of
       the API in order to improve our service and to ensure compliance
       with our policies.
    7. You will not attempt or encourage others to:
          + Re-sell, re-license or syndicate access to the API to third
            parties in a way that bypasses said third parties requirements
            to register with Fitbit for API access;
          + Perform wholesale export of Fitbit Data for the purpose of
            account migration or service duplication;
          + Render Fitbit Data within another product without complying
            with the display guidelines outlined below;
          + Use the API for purposes of publishing known bad data into the
            Fitbit system.
          + Use or access the API for the purpose of monitoring the
            performance or functionality of the Fitbit Platform or for any
            other benchmarking or competitive purposes.

   If you are unsure whether your intended use of the API is in compliance
   with these Terms of Service, please contact us at [12]api@fitbit.com to
   discuss, Additionally, please participate in the Fitbit API Developer
   Group located [13]here.

Principles & Best Practices

   When developing with the API, we ask that you honor the following
   Principles and Best Practices:

    1. Do not be destructive of User Data
          + Do your best to be true to user intent when capturing,
            recording or displaying User Data.
          + Do not overwrite or delete User Data without explicit User
            intent and confirmation.
          + Do not misrepresent data to a User after retrieval from or
            before submission to the Fitbit system. For example, when
            displaying User Data to be submitted to the Fitbit system,
            represent the data as it will be submitted, without
            potentially confusing summarization, aggregation or exchange
            of units.
    2. Respect Users and their Privacy
          + Be clear to Users about what User Data will be retrieved from
            or submitted to Fitbit when they use your Application.
          + Provide Users with a privacy policy for your Application that
            clearly discloses what you are doing with their User Data and
            any additional information you may collect, making sure that
            this privacy policy is available for a User’s review at the
            point of install and from within your Application’s User
            interface.
          + Do not display or distribute User Data to any external source
            without explicit User permission.
          + Do not facilitate or encourage the publishing of private or
            confidential information or User Data.
          + Do not allow your Application to violate a User’s Fitbit
            privacy settings.
          + Do not deliver, allow or enable the delivery of spam through
            your Application.
          + Ensure that your Application complies with the Fitbit Terms of
            Use.
          + Ensure that your Application complies with all relevant
            privacy and security laws, rules and regulations.
    3. Offer Users a clear path back to their Fitbit Account
          + Always provide clear documentation and links for Users to
            navigate to their Fitbit Account from your Application.
          + Paths to Fitbit User accounts should be available wherever
            User Data is displayed.
          + Paths to User's Fitbit accounts should be available in
            “Settings,” “Account” or a similar location from within your
            Application.
    4. Be a good partner to Fitbit
          + Work to compliment or extend the Fitbit Product and Services
            with your Application, without replacing the use of the Fitbit
            User Interface.
          + If your Application causes a User's account to violate the
            Fitbit Terms of Service, API access by your Application may be
            suspended or revoked.
          + Respect the intellectual property rights of others.
          + Respect the features and functionality of the Fitbit Product
            and Services and do not try to disrupt, circumvent, or disable
            any of those features or functionalities.
          + Do not use Fitbit’s name or trademarks as part of your name or
            the name of any Application you offer or in any manner that
            creates a false sense of endorsement or sponsorship by Fitbit.
          + Ensure that your Application complies with all applicable
            federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.

Integrating Fitbit Features into your Application

    1. Fitbit Login
          + Users must be presented with either the option to create a
            Fitbit Account, which will direct them to Fitbit.com, or to
            login to their Fitbit account using Fitbit's OAuth protocol.
    2. Privacy Settings
          + Honor each User’s Fitbit privacy settings when displaying data
            in your Application.

Display Guidelines & Trademark Usage

     * When displaying Fitbit Data in your Application, Fitbit should be
       noted as the source of that data.
     * When collecting Fitbit Data in your Application, it must be noted
       that the data will be published to Fitbit.
     * When displaying Fitbit Data in your Application, paths to the
       User's Fitbit Account should be available along with the data.
     * When displaying Fitbit Data in your Application, that data should
       be accompanied by the [14]Fitbit Logo and Logotype.
