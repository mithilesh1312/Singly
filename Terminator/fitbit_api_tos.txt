API Terms of Service

   These Terms of Service were last updated on February 10, 2012

   The Fitbit API (the "API") is provided as an asset to community members
   and partners to facilitate innovation in health, wellness and tracking
   applications. It is designed to interact with and enhance the Fitbit
   Tracker and the Fitbit user platform.

   While we try to provide the most open and flexible access we can, we
   aim to support a balance between developers' needs, users' privacy, and
   the integrity of Fitbit's product and business vision. To that end, we
   anticipate that the Fitbit Platform, our API and these Terms of Service
   will evolve over time. We will update these Terms of Service as needed
   or required and will always post such updates here.

   If there is a use case you would like to see covered that is not
   currently supported by the API or these Terms of Service, please
   contact us at [31]api@fitbit.com to discuss your needs. Additionally,
   please participate in the Fitbit API developer group, which can be
   found [32]here.

1. Certain definitions

   "Application(s)" means applications developed by you that interact with
   the Fitbit Platform.

   "Customer Data" means any data collected by users of your Developer
   Application, including but not limited to the names, addresses, URL's,
   or e-mail addresses of any Fitbit customer.

   "Fitbit Data" means the user data collected from the Fitbit Tracker and
   made available to you through the API.

   "Fitbit User Interface" means the Fitbit user interface, currently
   located at www.fitbit.com.

   "Fitbit Platform" means the Fitbit API, the Fitbit Data and the Fitbit
   User Interface.

   "User" means a registered user of your application.

   "User Data" means that subset of the Fitbit Data that is associated
   with a User.

2. Data access, Restrictions & policies

    a. You may use the API to develop Applications designed to interact
       with and enhance the Fitbit Platform or for data backup purposes.
    b. All access to and use of API, the Fitbit Data and/or the Fitbit
       User Interface, and any documentation or other assets provided to
       you by Fitbit shall be governed by these Terms of Service, in
       addition to the Fitbit Terms of Use
    c. The API is made available for the purposes of extending and
       improving the Fitbit product experience, and the API should not be
       used to create services that replace the Fitbit Platform.
    d. You may use the API to retrieve or post Fitbit Data, subscribe to
       User Data-feeds and render and display information in external
       applications according to these Terms of Service.
    e. Fitbit Data may be used solely as necessary to provide your
       Application to end users. You may make no further use of the Fitbit
       Data without express User consent.
    f. Use of the API is subject to restrictions on rate limit, use types
       and method calls as outlined on the Fitbit Developer Portal. If
       Fitbit reasonably believes that you have exceeded your rate limits
       or have attempted to circumvent the rate limit or authentication
       systems, your ability to utilize the API may be temporarily
       suspended or permanently revoked. Fitbit may monitor your usage of
       the API in order to improve our service and to ensure compliance
       with our policies.
    g. You will not attempt or encourage others to:
          + Re-sell, re-license or syndicate access to the API to third
            parties in a way that bypasses said third parties requirements
            to register with Fitbit for API access;
          + Perform wholesale export of Fitbit Data for the purpose of
            account migration or service duplication;
          + Render Fitbit Data within another product without complying
            with the display guidelines outlined below;
          + Use the API for purposes of publishing known bad data into the
            Fitbit system.
          + Use or access the API for the purpose of monitoring the
            performance or functionality of the Fitbit Platform or for any
            other benchmarking or competitive purposes.

   If you are unsure whether your intended use of the API is in compliance
   with these Terms of Service, please contact us at [33]api@fitbit.com to
   discuss. Additionally, please participate in the Fitbit API Developer
   Forum located [34]here.

3. Principles & Best Practices

   When developing with the API, we ask that you honor the following
   Principles and Best Practices:
    a. Do not be destructive of User Data
    b. Do your best to be true to user intent when capturing, recording or
       displaying User Data.
    c. Do not overwrite or delete User Data without explicit User intent
       and confirmation.
    d. Do not misrepresent data to a User after retrieval from or before
       submission to the Fitbit system. For example, when displaying User
       Data to be submitted to the Fitbit system, represent the data as it
       will be submitted, without potentially confusing summarization,
       aggregation or exchange of units.
    e. Respect Users and their Privacy
          + Be clear to Users about what User Data will be retrieved from
            or submitted to Fitbit when they use your Application.
          + Provide Users with a privacy policy for your Application that
            clearly discloses what you are doing with their User Data and
            any additional information you may collect, making sure that
            this privacy policy is available for a User's review at the
            point of install and from within your Application's User
            interface.
          + Do not display or distribute User Data to any external source
            without explicit User permission.
          + Do not facilitate or encourage the publishing of private or
            confidential information or User Data.
          + Do not allow your Application to violate a User's Fitbit
            privacy settings.
          + Do not deliver, allow or enable the delivery of spam through
            your Application.
          + Ensure that your Application complies with the Fitbit Terms of
            Use.
               o Ensure that your Application complies with all relevant
                 privacy and security laws, rules and regulations.
          + Offer Users a clear path back to their Fitbit Account
               o Always provide clear documentation and links for Users to
                 navigate to their Fitbit Account from your Application.
               o Paths to Fitbit User accounts should be available
                 wherever User Data is displayed.
               o Paths to User's Fitbit accounts should be available in
                 "Settings," "Account" or a similar location from within
                 your Application.
          + Be a good partner to Fitbit
               o Work to compliment or extend the Fitbit Product and
                 Services with your Application, without replacing the use
                 of the Fitbit User Interface.
               o If your Application causes a User's account to violate
                 the Fitbit Terms of Service, API access by your
                 Application may be suspended or revoked.
               o Respect the intellectual property rights of others.
               o Respect the features and functionality of the Fitbit
                 Product and Services and do not try to disrupt,
                 circumvent, or disable any of those features or
                 functionalities.
               o Do not use Fitbit's name or trademarks as part of your
                 name or the name of any Application you offer or in any
                 manner that creates a false sense of endorsement or
                 sponsorship by Fitbit.
               o Ensure that your Application complies with all applicable
                 federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.

4. Integrating Fitbit Features into your Application

    a. Fitbit Login
          + Users must be presented with either the option to create a
            Fitbit Account, which will direct them to Fitbit.com, or to
            login to their Fitbit account using Fitbit's OAuth protocol.
    b. Privacy Settings
          + Honor each User's Fitbit privacy settings when displaying data
            in your Application.

5. Data Display Acknowledgement Guidelines

    a. When displaying Fitbit Data in your Application, Fitbit should be
       noted as the source of that data using the text link and/or logo
       icon made available to you through Fitbit's Developer Portal.
    b. When collecting Fitbit Data in your Application, it must be noted
       that the data will be published to Fitbit.
    c. When displaying Fitbit Data in your Application, paths to the
       User's Fitbit Account should be available along with the data.

6. License; Ownership of Certain Intellectual Property

    a. Subject at all times to your full compliance with these Terms of
       Service, Fitbit grants you a nonexclusive, revocable,
       non-sublicensable, non-transferable royalty free license to use the
       API solely to develop reproduce and distribute Developer
       Applications. Fitbit has no obligation to provide any type of
       support for the Fitbit API or any services or content related
       thereto.
    b. You hereby grant to Fitbit a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty
       free, license to copy, display, perform, transmit, and use any
       Developer Applications and related marks and logos that you create
       using the Fitbit API, for the purposes of promoting Fitbit and
       marketing and providing those Developer Applications to customers.
       However, Fitbit has no obligation to use or promote any Developer
       Application. Further, you acknowledge that Fitbit reserves the
       right to disable or upgrade the Fitbit API and related services at
       any time without notice to you and without any form of compensation
       or consideration to you, regardless of the status of any Developer
       Applications. Fitbit has no obligation to ensure that an upgrade of
       the Fitbit API or related services will continue to be compatible
       with existing Developer Applications.
    c. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, including all
       copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights, in the
       Developer Applications necessary to offer the Developer
       Applications to end users and to grant the license to Fitbit in
       this Agreement.
    d. You, and not Fitbit, are responsible for providing all customer and
       technical support and maintenance for your Developer Applications.
       You agree to use commercially reasonable measures to maintain the
       security of Customer Data collected in connection with any of your
       products or services offered. You agree to not market, sell,
       transfer or disclose any such Customer Data to any third parties,
       except as expressly permitted by the customer or except as
       otherwise provided by law. Customers must be permitted to express
       contact preferences, via notice and opt-out, at the point of
       collection and in each subsequent marketing piece.

     * use the Fitbit API to design or develop anything other than
       Developer Applications;
     * modify, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, reverse
       compile, or disassemble the Fitbit API;
     * distribute, sell, lease, rent, lend, or sublicense any part of the

       Applications;
     * access or attempt to access any Fitbit server, computer system,
       service or content other than what is expressly authorized by

       racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
     * harm minors in any way;
     * impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to,
       any Fitbit representative, or misrepresent your affiliation with
       any person or entity;
     * forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to
       disguise the origin of any content transmitted;
     * upload or otherwise transmit any content that you do not have a
       right to transmit under any law or under contractual relationships;
     * upload or otherwise transmit any content that infringes any patent,
       trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights of
       any person;
     * upload or otherwise transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized
       advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain

9. Reservation of Rights and Ownership

   The Fitbit API is licensed, not sold, and Fitbit reserves all rights
   not expressly granted to you in this Agreement. This Agreement in no
   way conveys any ownership rights to you in any Fitbit platform, Fitbit
   data or Fitbit content accessed through your Developer Applications.

10. Website Links, Developer Application Naming Restrictions, and Use of
Fitbit Marks

    a. You may establish a link to the Fitbit website (www.fitbit.com),
       provided that the link does not state or imply that Fitbit sponsors
       or endorses any other web site, or presents Fitbit in a false,
       misleading, defamatory or derogatory manner. This permission to
       link to the Fitbit website does not permit you to use any Fitbit
       materials or content, unless separately agreed to in this Agreement
       or some other agreement with Fitbit.
    b. You may not use "FITBIT" or any variation thereof in the name of
       your Developer Applications. You may not use "FITBIT" or any
       variation thereof in any domain name, email address, keyword or
       social media user name.
    c. You may make truthful, factual references to Fitbit in plain-text
       prose descriptions of your Developer Applications' features and
       benefits (including references to a Developer Application's
       interoperability with Fitbit). For example, the FITBIT trademark
       can only be used in the manner shown in one of the referential
       descriptions below:
          + "Designed for use with the FITBIT® platform"
          + "For use with FITBIT® [insert particular feature/product
            name]"
          + "Synchs with FITBIT® [insert particular feature/product name]"
          + "Designed to interact with FITBIT® data"
       These phrases can appear near, but must be completely separate and
       apart from the name/logo of the Developer Application. The font
       size of phrases using the FITBIT mark should not be larger than the
       surrounding font, and should not appear more prominently than the
       name/logo of the Developer Application.
    d. In all materials that contain an approved phrase as set out above,
       including product packaging, the following legend must also be
       placed in the "fine print" of such materials. The legend may be in
       a small type size, but must still be legible: "Fitbit is a
       registered trademark and service mark of Fitbit, Inc. [Insert name
       of the Developer Application] is designed for use with the Fitbit
       platform. This product is not put out by Fitbit, and Fitbit does
       not service or warrant the functionality of this product."
    e. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not include the
       right to use any Fitbit logo (each a "Fitbit Logo" and together the
       "Fitbit Logos") as part of any brand for the Developer Applications
       themselves, or as part of any brand(s) or trade name(s) or other
       designators for your business or non-tested products. The Fitbit
       Logo may be used only in the size and format made available to you
       through Fitbit's Developer Portal to label or designate data
       records fetched from the Fitbit Platform. You may not be use the
       Fitbit Logos in any other manner, including but not limited to use
       on promotional materials, standalone technical support or
       consulting services, or other goods or services without Fitbit's
       explicit written permission.

11. Your Feedback

   Any feedback, suggestions and ideas ("Feedback") that you provide to
   Fitbit regarding the Fitbit API, the Fitbit website, Fitbit products,
   or content or services related thereto will be treated by Fitbit as
   non-confidential, and Fitbit may, in its sole discretion, use the
   Feedback you provide to Fitbit in any way, including in future
   modifications of the Fitbit API, services, products, multimedia works
   and/or advertising and promotional materials relating thereto. You
   hereby grant Fitbit a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable,
   irrevocable, royalty free license to use, reproduce, modify, create
   derivative works from, distribute and display the Feedback in any
   manner and for any purpose.

12. Termination

   You may terminate any license granted to you hereunder at any time by
   ceasing your access to and use of the API and any use of the Fitbit
   Data. We may immediately suspend your access to the API and the Fitbit
   Data or, if necessary, terminate this agreement in its entirely at any
   time and without notice to you if, in our sole and reasonable judgment
   we believe that you have breached these Terms of Service or have
   otherwise engaged in activity that may cause liability to Fitbit. We
   may also terminate any license provided to you hereunder for any reason
   with at least thirty (30) days notice to you. Fitbit will not be liable
   for any costs, expenses, or damages that may result from termination of
   this agreement. The following Sections of this Agreement shall survive
   any termination or expiration:

   Upon any termination of this agreement, you will promptly cease using
   the API and the Fitbit Data.

13. Confidentiality

   You may be given access to certain non-public proprietary information,
   software and specifications related to the API and the Fitbit Product
   and Services (the "Confidential Information"). You may use this
   Confidential Information only as necessary in exercising the rights
   granted to you by these Terms of Service. You may not disclose any
   Confidential Information to any third party without our prior written
   consent and you agree that you will protect this Confidential
   Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same
   manner that you would use to protect your own confidential and
   proprietary information of a similar nature and in any event with no
   less than a reasonable degree of care. This section shall survive
   termination of these Terms of Service.

14. Disclaimers

   THE FITBIT DATA, THE API, AND THE FITBIT PLATFORM, ALONG WITH ANY OTHER
   MATERIALS PROVIDED BY FITBIT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE FITBIT
   API ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR
   OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. FITBIT DOES NOT
   WARRANT THAT THE API, THE FITBIT PLATFORM OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS
   PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE ERROR FREE,
   UNINTERRUPTED, VIRUS FREE OR SECURE.

15. Limitation of Liability

   IN NO EVENT WILL FITBIT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
   EXEMPLARY, PUMITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE,
   DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
   AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE API OR FITBIT PLATFORM, WHETHER ARISING
   FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
   YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. THE
   FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY
   SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESENTIAL
   PURPOSE. IN ANY CASE, FITBIT'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
   WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE
   AGGREGATE FEES YOU PAID FOR ACCESS TO THE API DURING THE LAST YEAR.

16. Indemnification

   You will indemnify, defend and hold Fitbit, its subsidiaries,
   affiliates, officers and employees harmless from and against any and
   all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, actions, judgments, costs,
   and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) brought by a third

   Fitbit Marks; (b) your use of the API, Fitbit Platform or the Fitbit
   Marks other than as expressly allowed by these Terms of Service; (c)
   your breach or alleged breach of the terms, restrictions, obligations
   or representations included in these Terms of Service; or (d) your
   Application. You will assume control of the defense and settlement of
   any claim subject to indemnification by you; provided, however, that
   Fitbit may, at any time, elect to take control of the defense and
