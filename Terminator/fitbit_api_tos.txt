API Terms of Service

   These Terms of Service were last updated on February 10, 2012

   The Fitbit API (the "API") is provided as an asset to community members
   and partners to facilitate innovation in health, wellness and tracking
   applications. It is designed to interact with and enhance the Fitbit
   Tracker and the Fitbit user platform.

   While we try to provide the most open and flexible access we can, we
   aim to support a balance between developers' needs, users' privacy, and
   the integrity of Fitbit's product and business vision. To that end, we
   anticipate that the Fitbit Platform, our API and these Terms of Service
   will evolve over time. We will update these Terms of Service as needed
   or required and will always post such updates here.

   If there is a use case you would like to see covered that is not
   currently supported by the API or these Terms of Service, please
   contact us at [11]api@fitbit.com to discuss your needs. Additionally,
   please participate in the Fitbit API developer group, which can be
   found [12]here.

   "Application(s)" means applications developed by you that interact with
   the Fitbit Platform.

   "Customer Data" means any data collected by users of your Developer
   Application, including but not limited to the names, addresses, URL's,
   or e-mail addresses of any Fitbit customer.

   "Fitbit Data" means the user data collected from the Fitbit Tracker and
   made available to you through the API.

   "User Data" means that subset of the Fitbit Data that is associated
   with a User.

2. Data Access, Restrictions & Policies

    1. You may use the API to develop Applications designed to interact
       with and enhance the Fitbit Platform or for data backup purposes.
    2. All access to and use of API, the Fitbit Data and/or the Fitbit
       User Interface, and any documentation or other assets provided to
       you by Fitbit shall be governed by these Terms of Service, in
       addition to the [14]Fitbit Terms of Use
    3. The API is made available for the purposes of extending and
       improving the Fitbit product experience, and the API should not be
       used to create services that replace the Fitbit Platform.

       User Data-feeds and render and display information in external
       applications according to these Terms of Service.

       suspended or permanently revoked. Fitbit may monitor your usage of
       the API in order to improve our service and to ensure compliance

    7. You will not attempt or encourage others to:
          + Re-sell, re-license or syndicate access to the API to third

3. Principles & Best Practices

   When developing with the API, we ask that you honor the following
   Principles and Best Practices:
    1. Do not be destructive of User Data
    2. Do your best to be true to user intent when capturing, recording or
       displaying User Data.
    3. Do not overwrite or delete User Data without explicit User intent
       and confirmation.
    4. Do not misrepresent data to a User after retrieval from or before
       submission to the Fitbit system. For example, when displaying User
       Data to be submitted to the Fitbit system, represent the data as it
       will be submitted, without potentially confusing summarization,
       aggregation or exchange of units.
    5. Respect Users and their Privacy
          + Be clear to Users about what User Data will be retrieved from
            or submitted to Fitbit when they use your Application.
          + Provide Users with a privacy policy for your Application that
            clearly discloses what you are doing with their User Data and
            any additional information you may collect, making sure that
            this privacy policy is available for a User's review at the
            point of install and from within your Application's User
            interface.
          + Do not display or distribute User Data to any external source
            without explicit User permission.
          + Do not facilitate or encourage the publishing of private or
            confidential information or User Data.
          + Do not allow your Application to violate a User's Fitbit
            privacy settings.
          + Do not deliver, allow or enable the delivery of spam through
            your Application.
          + Ensure that your Application complies with the Fitbit Terms of
            Use.
               o Ensure that your Application complies with all relevant
                 privacy and security laws, rules and regulations.
    6. Offer Users a clear path back to their Fitbit Account
          + Always provide clear documentation and links for Users to
            navigate to their Fitbit Account from your Application.
          + Paths to Fitbit User accounts should be available wherever
            User Data is displayed.
          + Paths to User's Fitbit accounts should be available in
            "Settings," "Account" or a similar location from within your
            Application.
    7. Be a good partner to Fitbit
          + Work to compliment or extend the Fitbit Product and Services
            with your Application, without replacing the use of the Fitbit
            User Interface.
          + If your Application causes a User's account to violate the
            Fitbit Terms of Service, API access by your Application may be
            suspended or revoked.
          + Respect the intellectual property rights of others.
          + Respect the features and functionality of the Fitbit Product
            and Services and do not try to disrupt, circumvent, or disable
            any of those features or functionalities.
          + Do not use Fitbit's name or trademarks as part of your name or
            the name of any Application you offer or in any manner that
            creates a false sense of endorsement or sponsorship by Fitbit.
          + Ensure that your Application complies with all applicable
            federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.

4. Integrating Fitbit Features into your Application

    1. Fitbit Login
          + Users must be presented with either the option to create a
            Fitbit Account, which will direct them to Fitbit.com, or to
            login to their Fitbit account using Fitbit's OAuth protocol.
    2. Privacy Settings
          + Honor each User's Fitbit privacy settings when displaying data
            in your Application.

5. Data Display Acknowledgement Guidelines

    1. When displaying Fitbit Data in your Application, Fitbit should be
       noted as the source of that data using the text link and/or logo
       icon made available to you through Fitbit's Developer Portal.
    2. When collecting Fitbit Data in your Application, it must be noted
       that the data will be published to Fitbit.

       registered trademark and service mark of Fitbit, Inc. [Insert name
       of the Developer Application] is designed for use with the Fitbit
       platform. This product is not put out by Fitbit, and Fitbit does
       not service or warrant the functionality of this product."
    5. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not include the

       designators for your business or non-tested products. The Fitbit
