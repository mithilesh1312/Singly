   API Terms of Use

   We’re excited that you’ve chosen to develop on the LinkedIn platform.
   Our Developer Program enables you to create innovative professional
   applications that make the best use of LinkedIn. When you develop on
   the LinkedIn platform you are agreeing to be bound by the following
   terms, so please take a few minutes to read over the LinkedIn API Terms
   of Use below.

   Last revised on February 12, 2015.

1. Introduction

   When you develop on our platform you are entering into a legal
   agreement and you agree to all of these terms.

   As a member of LinkedIn, you also have agreed to our [14]User
   Agreement, [15]Privacy Policy and [16]Cookie Policy - these terms are
   additional agreements with LinkedIn relating specifically to your use
   of our APIs.

1.1 About Us and These API Terms of Use

   You agree that by developing on the LinkedIn platform, you are entering
   into a legally binding agreement with LinkedIn Corporation (if you
   reside in the United States), 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View,
   California 94043, USA or LinkedIn Ireland Limited (if you reside
   outside of the United States), Gardner House, Wilton Plaza, Wilton
   Place, Dublin 2, Ireland (“we,” “us,” “our,” and “LinkedIn”).

   By registering a software application, website, or product you create
   or a service you offer (an “Application”) at the [17]LinkedIn Developer
   Network site (the “Developer Site”), you acknowledge that you are
   currently a member of LinkedIn and have read and understood and agree
   to be bound by these LinkedIn API Terms of Use (the “Terms”).

   If you are developing on our platform on behalf of a company or other
   entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to
   register an Application on behalf of that entity and bind it to these
   Terms. If you are not authorized, you may not accept the Terms or
   register an Application for someone else.

   To achieve our mission of connecting the world’s professionals, we make
   APIs available to developers to create applications for our members.

1.2 Purpose

   Our mission is to connect the world’s professionals to allow them to be
   more productive and successful. To achieve our mission, we make APIs
   available to third party developers such as you to create applications
   for our members and customers.

   These Terms govern your use of our APIs unless you have executed
   another agreement with us related to your use of our APIs, in which
   case, those terms would govern your use of our APIs.

   LinkedIn also offers a partner program, governed by a signed
   partnership agreement, and a variety of plugins, governed by the
   LinkedIn [18]Plugins License Agreement.

1.3 Scope and Intent

   These Terms govern your use of our APIs unless you have executed
   another agreement with LinkedIn that expressly governs your use of our
   APIs.

   You may develop Applications using LinkedIn APIs as soon as your
   register an Application and you agree to follow these terms, if the
   Applications meet the eligibility criteria described below. Note, that
   upon prior approval, LinkedIn may enable you to access more LinkedIn
   data than is generally publicly available via the APIs.

   LinkedIn also offers a (a) “Partner Program,” where you can apply to
   develop applications if they meet our Partner Program eligibility
   criteria and you have entered into a signed partnership agreement with
   LinkedIn, and (b) variety of plugins you can integrate into your
   website to allow visitors to access and view content on LinkedIn
   websites if you have agreed to be bound, in addition to these Terms, to
   the LinkedIn [19]Plugins License Agreement.

   As used in these Terms, “APIs” means programmatic web APIs and
   associated tools and documentation that LinkedIn makes available under
   these Terms.

   You may use the APIs if your Application is designed to help LinkedIn
   members be more productive and successful.

   You may not use the APIs if your Application: exceeds a reasonable
   amount of API calls; relies fundamentally on the APIs; stores more than
   a LinkedIn member’s profile data; or is used for hiring, marketing or
   selling.

1.4 Eligibility Criteria

   Here is the eligibility criteria to determine if you may use the APIs
   pursuant to these Terms:

   You may use our APIs if:
    1. you are developing an Application designed to help LinkedIn members
       be more productive and successful across the web; for example, by
       augmenting their profile and professional brand in an Application
       for publishing, discussing and sharing content with like-minded
       professionals.
    2. your Application is NOT expected to: have more than 250,000
       lifetime members; make more than 500,000 daily calls to an API;
       make more than 500,000 lifetime people search calls to an API; or
       serve greater than 1 million daily plugin impressions.
    3. your Application DOES NOT rely on access to the APIs as a
       fundamental aspect of your business.
    4. your Application WILL NOT store or export any data from LinkedIn
       other than the LinkedIn Profile Data for the LinkedIn member that
       requested the data.  “Profile Data” means the name, photo,
       headline, contact information, experience, education, summary, and
       location of a LinkedIn member. Profile Data excludes connections,
       network updates, job listings, groups, companies, and any other
       content.
    5. your Application DOES NOT target current or potential paying
       customers of LinkedIn products or people engaging in activities
       related to those products—in other words, Applications used for
       hiring, marketing, or selling. Here are some examples (and
       exceptions) of what we mean by hiring, marketing and selling:
       Hiring: Applications to find a job or fill a job, such as ones used
       to advertise, post, apply for, search for, recommend, refer,
       suggest, enhance listings for, or fill permanent jobs, contract
       positions, or volunteer opportunities, or for anything with a
       similar functionality (you can, however, use the APIs to develop an
       Application to let people apply for a job on your company’s career
       site, as long as it abides by the [20]specification set forth
       here).
       Marketing: Applications used by marketers or their customers for
       marketing campaigns, lead generation, campaign analysis, or for
       anything with similar functionality (you can, however, use the APIs
       to develop an Application to let companies manage their social
       media presence on LinkedIn, as long as it abides by [21]Section 4.5
       below (“Social Media Management: Company Profile and Statistics
       Data”)).
       Selling: Applications used by sales or other outbound professionals
       for generating or finding prospects or leads, for sales
       intelligence or training, for relationship management, for
       systematic matching of individuals with their LinkedIn profiles, or
       for anything with similar functionality.

   If your Application does not satisfy the above eligibility criteria,
   you may be eligible for the Partner Program. For more information about
   the Partner Program application process, eligibility criteria and the
   areas where we are looking for partners, [22]click here.

2. Access to Self-Service Program

   To access the APIs you must sign-in to LinkedIn and register an
   Application.

2.1   Developer Account

   To begin using the APIs, you must first sign-in to LinkedIn using your
   real LinkedIn account user name and password and then register your
   Application by clicking [23]My Apps and following the instructions
   provided thereafter. Both the Application registration and your
   LinkedIn member account must contain accurate and up-to-date
   information at all times, including your current title, company, and
   e-mail address. You agree that we can use, store, and share information
   submitted by you to LinkedIn in connection with your Application
   registration as permitted in our Privacy Policy.

   Once you have successfully registered an Application, you will be given
   the necessary credentials to access the APIs.

   All activities that occur using those access credentials are your
   responsibility.

2.2   Access Credentials

   Once you have successfully registered an Application, you will be given
   Access Credentials for your Application. “Access Credentials” means the
   necessary security keys, secrets, tokens, and other credentials to
   access the APIs. The Access Credentials enable us to associate your API
   activity with your Application and the LinkedIn members using it. All
   activities that occur using your Access Credentials are your
   responsibility. Keep them secret. Do not sell, transfer, or sublicense
   them. Do not try to circumvent them and do not require your members to
   obtain their own Access Credentials to use your Application (for
   example, in an attempt to circumvent call limits).

   You may create LinkedIn test accounts to test your Application,
   provided that they do not interact with real LinkedIn members or
   groups.

2.3   Test Account

   You may create up to five LinkedIn test accounts for purposes of
   testing your Application only. You must create the accounts manually
   and not via any automated means, such as scripts.

   These test accounts must not interact with non-test accounts (for
   example, you can’t use test accounts to comment to posts on a Company
   Page and you can’t connect test accounts with non-test accounts,
   including your LinkedIn account), or override our API call limits. You
   must clearly identify the accounts as test accounts in the applicable
   account profile, and must identify these additional account profiles as
   “Developers” in your Application registration. You may not create any
   profile positions at real companies (besides your own) through the test
   accounts.

   If you agree to and follow these terms, you are free to use our APIs.

2.4   API License

   As long as you follow these Terms, we grant you a limited,
   non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable license under
   LinkedIn’s intellectual property rights to use the APIs to develop,
   test, and support your Application, and to let your customers use your
   integration of the APIs within your Application.

3. Use of APIs and LinkedIn Content

   Members’ LinkedIn data is private and cannot be shared with other users
   of your application without their express permission.

3.1   Display and Use Data Properly

   Members’ views of their LinkedIn networks are private to them, based on
   the connections they have. Each LinkedIn member must give you express
   permission to access their LinkedIn account and network through your
   Application and to share their profile data with third parties.  You
   must provide the LinkedIn member’s account and network information only
   to that LinkedIn member and no one else. In addition, your Application
   must not permit LinkedIn members to share their networks or data about
   their networks to anyone else.

   You must not:


    1. Use data from the APIs or Website for advertising;
    2. Use content from the APIs or Website for promotions or mass
       messaging;
    3. Distribute data from the APIs or Website to anybody other than your
       Application’s users;
    4. Commingle data from the APIs with data scraped from our Website; or
    5. Use someone’s credentials to show their LinkedIn data to someone
       else.

3.2 Excluded Uses of Content

   You must never do any of the following:
    1. Use LinkedIn Content in any advertisements, or for purposes of
       targeting advertisements, in your Application or elsewhere.
       “Content” means any data or content from our Website or accessed
       via the APIs. Our “Website” means LinkedIn’s websites at[24]
       www.linkedin.com, [25]www.slideshare.net, and any other website or
       service owned or operated by LinkedIn.
    2. Use the Content for any of the following: generating messages,
       promotions, offers, or mass messages or for any other purpose other
       than to allow your users to use the Content in your Application.
       This includes using the Content to send a mass message to LinkedIn
       members asking them to interact with each other, such as to rate
       each other.
    3. Share (except to your Application's users), transfer, sublicense,
       sell or lease any Content or access to any Content, directly or
       indirectly (e.g., through multiple tiers of distribution), to
       anybody (e.g., you may not sell access to an aggregated collection
       of LinkedIn member profiles or the most relevant LinkedIn members
       for a position). That includes data brokers, salespeople,
       advertisers, social or professional networks, recruiters, or anyone
       besides yourself or the company on whose behalf you agreed to these
       Terms.
    4. Commingle or supplement Content from the APIs with any other
       LinkedIn data. For example, you cannot supplement the data you have
       received via a LinkedIn API with data scraped from our Website
       (whether that scraping was done by you or someone else) or from any
       other source.
    5. Use someone’s Member Token or OAuth Token (as those terms are
       defined below) to show his or her Content to someone else (e.g., as
       part of search results). Each LinkedIn member must authenticate
       individually to retrieve his or her Content through the APIs.

   You must not:


    1. Include inappropriate content in your Application;
    2. Mingle data from the APIs or Website with third party search
       results; or
    3. Allow access to the stand-alone APIs.

3.3   Excluded Uses of the APIs

   You must never do any of the following under these Terms:
    1. Use the APIs in any Application that includes adult content,
       promotes gambling, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to
       persons under 21 years of age, or otherwise violates any applicable
       law or regulation.
    2. Use the APIs to retrieve Content that is then aggregated with third
       party search results in such a way that an end user cannot
       attribute the Content to LinkedIn (i.e., aggregated search
       results).
    3. Distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs to anyone other
       than the company on whose behalf you agreed to these Terms, or
       create an application programming interface that enables access to
       Content. Anyone who wants to access our APIs and Content must agree
       to be bound by the applicable terms of use.

4. Storage of Content

   You may not store any LinkedIn content, except in the specific
   circumstances outlined below.

4.1   No Storing Any Content

   You must not copy or store any Content or capture or store any
   information expressed by the Content (such as hashed or transformed
   data), except to the extent permitted by these Terms.

   You may store the LinkedIn member IDs and authentication tokens
   acquired on a LinkedIn member’s behalf.

4.2   You May Store Tokens

   You may store the Application-specific alphanumeric user IDs that we
   provide to you for identifying users of your Application (“Member
   Tokens”) or the tokens that we provide to you when a LinkedIn member
   authenticates your Application to his or her LinkedIn account (“OAuth
   Tokens”).

   To improve your Application’s performance, you may cache content for up
   to 24 hours.

4.3   Caching Content for Performance

   To improve the user experience, you may cache the Content for up to 24
   hours from a request for that Content through the APIs before being
   deleted. This limited permission to cache is for performance reasons
   only. You do not have any rights to store the Content beyond this
   limited 24-hour period.

   You may store profile data if you have the [26]consent of the LinkedIn
   member to do so.

   You may only refresh profile data when the LinkedIn member is actively
   using your Application (i.e., not off-line).

   You may only use the profile data for the benefit of the LinkedIn
   member that granted you permission to access it.

4.4   LinkedIn Member Profile Data

   You may store a LinkedIn member’s Profile Data if you have the consent
   of the LinkedIn member to do so; for example, so that a LinkedIn member
   applying for a job at your company can provide you with a copy of their
   profile.

   The process for obtaining LinkedIn member consent must meet the
   [27]specifications set forth here. If you want to refresh the LinkedIn
   member’s Profile Data, you may only do so when the member is actually
   using your Application and not on an automated schedule. You must use
   stored Profile Data solely for the benefit of the LinkedIn member that
   granted you permission to access it; for example, to evaluate that
   LinkedIn member for a position in your company.

   For social media management, you may store company page profile data
   and related statistics for your company or your clients, if those
   clients know that you are storing such data.

   That data must be deleted promptly when a client stops receiving data
   through your Application or when these Terms end.

4.5   Social Media Management: Company Profile and Statistics Data

   You may store company page status updates, analytics on company page
   status updates, company follower analytics data, and text content of
   comments on company status updates received via the Company Share API
   (“Company Profile and Statistics Data”) on behalf of your company and
   clients (to the extent that your clients know that you are storing
   their data). Company Profile and Statistics Data excludes any personal
   information tied to members who posted comments on any company page.
   You must not commingle the Company Profile and Statistics Data with any
   of your data or with data belonging to any third party.

   As soon as your client elects to stop receiving LinkedIn Content
   through your Application or upon such client’s request, you must
   permanently delete the client’s Company Profile and Statistics Data in
   10 days or less. Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, you
   must permanently delete all Company Profile and Statistics Data for all
   clients.

   You must delete all LinkedIn member data when that member uninstalls
   your Application or closes his or her account.

   You do not need to delete data that a LinkedIn member provides directly
   to you.

4.6   Delete at LinkedIn Member Request

   You must delete all Content collected with the LinkedIn member’s
   consent, including the Member Token and the OAuth Token, upon request
   by that LinkedIn member, when the LinkedIn member uninstalls your
   Application or when the LinkedIn member closes his or her account with
   you.

   The restrictions of this Section do not apply to data that LinkedIn
   members provide directly to you and that is separately entered or
   uploaded to you by the user of your Application.

   If we notify you that you have breached these Terms, you must delete
   all stored LinkedIn data.

4.7   Delete for Breach

   You must immediately delete all Content if we terminate your use of the
   APIs for breach of these Terms, except when doing so would cause you to
   violate any law or obligation imposed by a governmental authority.

5. Don't Harm or Trick LinkedIn Members

   Your Application must include your own user agreement and privacy
   policy and be readily available to your users.

5.1   Your User Agreement and Privacy Policy

   Your Application must include your own user agreement and privacy
   policy. Your user agreement and privacy policy must be prominently
   identified or located where members download or access your
   Application.  Your privacy policy must meet applicable legal standards
   and accurately describe the collection, use, storage and sharing of
   data.

   You must promptly notify us of any breaches of your user agreement or
   privacy policy that impact or may impact LinkedIn members. Your privacy
   policy must be at least as stringent and user-friendly as LinkedIn’s.

   You must tell LinkedIn members what information your Application
   collects and how it’s used.

5.2   LinkedIn Member Consent

   Before obtaining information from LinkedIn members, you must obtain
   their informed consent by telling them what information you collect and
   how it will be used, stored or shared.

   You and your Application must not:


    1. Harm LinkedIn members;
    2. Discriminate against LinkedIn members in inappropriate ways;
    3. Impersonate or misrepresent LinkedIn members;
    4. Hide LinkedIn buttons or consent flows from LinkedIn members;
    5. Proxy, request or use LinkedIn account user names or passwords for
       any reason;
    6. Request more LinkedIn data than is necessary;
    7. Exceed call limits;
    8. Scrape our Website;
    9. Copy or modify LinkedIn materials; or
   10. Interfere with any LinkedIn services or systems.

5.3   Application Restrictions

   You and your Application must not do the following:
    1. Implement features or business practices that harm the professional
       reputation, relationships, or professional ecosystem of LinkedIn
       members.
    2. Use Content received from the APIs in any manner that facilitates
       bias or data "redlining," whether intentional or inadvertent, based
       on sensitive or protected categories or characteristics.  We want
       all LinkedIn members to enjoy access to the economic opportunities
       LinkedIn and the Applications have to offer.
    3. Impersonate a LinkedIn member or misrepresent any LinkedIn member
       or other third party when requesting or publishing information.
    4. Obfuscate or hide any LinkedIn buttons, sign-in functionality, or
       consent or authorization flows from your users. In order to access
       LinkedIn member-specific Content through the APIs, your users must
       sign-in with their LinkedIn credentials and grant your Application
       access to their Content.
    5. Proxy, request, or use LinkedIn account user names or passwords in
       any fashion for any reason. We want LinkedIn members to have safe
       and consistent experiences across all Applications.
    6. Request from the APIs more than the minimum data fields and
       application permissions your Application needs.
    7. Try to exceed or circumvent limitations on calls and use. This
       includes creating multiple Applications for identical, or largely
       similar, usage (e.g., having one Application per customer).
    8. Download, scrape, post, or transmit, in any form or by any means,
       any part of our Website. This includes data retrieved by web
       browser plugins.
    9. Copy, reformat, reverse-engineer, or otherwise modify the APIs,
       Access Credentials, our Website or any Content.
   10. Interfere with or disrupt LinkedIn services or servers or networks
       connected to LinkedIn services, or disobey any requirements,
       procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to
       LinkedIn services.

6. Treat the LinkedIn Brand With Respect

   We grant you a limited right to use our brand to promote or advertise
   your Application’s integration of the APIs.

6.1   Brand Features License and Publicity Rights

   Subject to these Terms, including the [28]Branding Guidelines, we grant
   you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicenseable, and
   non-transferable license during the Term to display our Brand Features
   to promote or advertise your integration of the APIs in your
   Application. “Brand Features” means any trade names, trademarks,
   service marks, logos and domain names that LinkedIn makes available to
   you.

   You may promote your Application, including talking to traditional and
   online media and your users about your Application, so long as you do
   so truthfully and without implying that your Application is created or
   endorsed by LinkedIn (or otherwise embellishing your relationship with
   LinkedIn). However, you may not issue any formal press release via
   traditional or online media referring to LinkedIn without LinkedIn’s
   prior consent, unless expressly allowed in the [29]Branding Guidelines.

   Don’t use our brand in a malicious way, and preserve any legal notices
   contained in materials you receive from us.

6.2   LinkedIn Brand Use Restrictions

   You must not:
    1. Display our Brand Features in any way that is misleading,
       defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene, or
       otherwise objectionable to LinkedIn in its sole discretion; or
    2. Remove any legal, copyright, trademark, watermark or other
       proprietary rights notices contained in or on Content or any other
       materials you receive or access pursuant to these Terms.

   We may refer to you as a licensee of the APIs.

6.3   Publicity by Us

   We may publicly refer to you, orally or in writing, as a licensee of
   the APIs. We may also publish your name and logo (with or without a
   link to your Application) on our Website, in press releases, and in
   promotional materials without additional consent.

7. Safety and Abuse

   Your systems must be configured to securely operate your Application
   and store data.

   You must notify LinkedIn of any security incident and you will work
   with LinkedIn to remediate any security incident.

7.1   Security Measures

   Your network, operating system and the software of your web servers,
   databases, and computer systems (collectively, “Systems”) must be
   properly configured to securely operate your Application and store
   Content. Your Application must use reasonable security measures to
   protect the private information of your users. You must not architect
   or select Systems in a manner to avoid the foregoing obligation.

   You must promptly report any security deficiencies in, or intrusions
   to, your Systems that you discover to LinkedIn in writing via email to
   security@linkedin.com or subsequent contact information posted in the
   Developer Site. You will work with LinkedIn to immediately correct any
   security deficiency, and will immediately disconnect any intrusions or
   intruder. In the event of any security deficiency or intrusion
   involving the Application, APIs or Content, you will make no public
   statements (e.g. press, blogs, social media, bulletin boards, etc.)
   without prior written and express permission from LinkedIn in each
   instance.

   LinkedIn may restrict access to the APIs if you fail to provide
   adequate information and materials to verify your compliance with these
   Terms.

7.2   Monitoring

   You agree to assist LinkedIn in verifying your compliance with these
   Terms by providing us with information about your Application and
   storage of Content, which may also include access to your Application
   and other materials related to your use of the APIs. If you do not
   demonstrate full compliance with these Terms, we may restrict or
   terminate your access to the APIs.

8. Rights LinkedIn Reserves

   Although we make reasonable efforts to support the APIs, we have no
   obligation to do so.

   If we change any of the APIs in the future, your continued use implies
   that you agree to any changes made.

8.1   Support and Modifications

   We may provide you with support or modifications for the APIs in our
   sole discretion and we may stop providing support or modifications to
   you at any time without notice or liability to you.

   We may release subsequent versions of the APIs and require that you use
   those subsequent versions. Your continued use of the APIs following a
   subsequent release will be deemed your acceptance of modifications.

   LinkedIn currently does not charge a fee for use of the APIs, but may
   choose to in the future.

8.2   Fees

   The APIs are currently provided for free, but LinkedIn reserves the
   right to charge for the APIs in the future. If we do charge a fee for
   use of the APIs or any developer tools and features, you do not have
   any obligation to continue to use LinkedIn’s developer resources.

   These Terms do not prevent LinkedIn from developing something similar
   to your Application.

8.3   LinkedIn Independent Development

   You understand and acknowledge that LinkedIn may be independently
   creating applications, content, and other products or services that may
   be similar to or competitive with your Application. Nothing in these
   Terms will be construed as restricting or preventing LinkedIn from
   creating and fully exploiting any applications, content, and other
   items, without any obligation to you.

   LinkedIn may use personal information about developers for purposes in
   addition to those described in our Privacy Policy.

8.4   Developer Exception to our Privacy Policy

   LinkedIn may reveal personal information about developers for
   attribution purposes, handling inquiries from members or potential
   members, and other purposes LinkedIn reasonably deems necessary under
   these Terms.

9. Ownership

   We own the APIs, Content, Website and Brand Features.

9.1   LinkedIn Property

   As between you and us, we own all rights, title, and interest,
   including all intellectual property rights, in and to, the (1) APIs,
   and all elements, components, and executables of the APIs; (2) Content;
   (3) Website; and (4) Brand Features (clauses (1)-(4) collectively, the

   or entity), or any applicable regulation or law, including the Digital
   Millennium Copyright Act, the laws of any country in which your
   Application is made available and any applicable export laws.

   current version of these Terms can be reviewed on the Developer Site.

   We reserve the right to modify, supplement, or replace the terms of
   these Terms, effective prospectively upon posting on the Developer Site
   or otherwise notifying you. For example, we may present a banner on the
   Developer Site when we have amended these Terms so that you may access
   and review the changes prior to your continued use of the APIs and
   Developer Site. If you do not want to agree to changes to these Terms,
   you can terminate these Terms at any time in accordance with

   We may discontinue the availability of some or all of the APIs at any
   time for any reason. We may also impose limits on certain features and

    4. unless we agree otherwise in writing or as stated in these Terms,
       you must permanently delete all Content or other data which you
       stored pursuant to your use of the APIs. LinkedIn may request that

   Affiliates (and our and their respective employees, shareholders, and
   directors) from any claim or action brought by a third party, including

   or your brand features.

   13. Dispute Resolution

   Any legal dispute arising out of these Terms will take place in
   California courts, applying California law, unless the parties agree
   otherwise or the claim is arbitrated.

13.1  Law and Forum for Legal Disputes

   These Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute (“Claim”) arising
   out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the
   state of California, United States, regardless of your country of
   origin or where you access LinkedIn, and notwithstanding any conflicts
   of law principles and the United Nations Convention for the
   International Sale of Goods.

   You and LinkedIn agree that all Claims arising out of or related to
   these Terms must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court
   located in Santa Clara County, California, except as otherwise agreed
   by the parties or as described in [36]Section 13.2 below. You and
   LinkedIn agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts
   located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of
   litigating all such Claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that
   LinkedIn shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
   equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

   In the event of litigation between the parties arising out of or
   related to these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to
   recover its attorneys' fees and costs incurred.

   For claims less than $10,000, the parties may choose binding
   arbitration as an alternative to legal action.

13.2  Arbitration Option

   For any Claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
   relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than
   $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the Claim in
   a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based
   arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall
   initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute
   resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties.

   The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:
    1. the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be
       solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be
       chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;
    2. the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the
       parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
       parties; and
    3. any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final
       and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

14. General Terms

   This Section 14, provides important details to help you read these
   Terms.

14.1  Severability

   If any provision of these Terms is found to be illegal, void, or
   unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be modified so as to
   render it enforceable to the maximum extent possible in order to effect
   the intention of the provision; if a term cannot be so modified, it
   will be severed and the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be
   affected in any way.

14.2  Language

   Where LinkedIn has provided you with a translation of the English
   language version of these Terms or any document referenced in these
   Terms, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience

   matter of these Terms.
