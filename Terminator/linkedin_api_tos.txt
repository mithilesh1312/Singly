LinkedIn APIs Terms of Use

   Thu, 10/22/2009 - 21:36 — LIDeveloperAdmin

   We’re glad you’ve chosen to use the LinkedIn APIs. By using one or more
   of the LinkedIn APIs (the "LinkedIn APIs" or “APIs”), you and, if
   applicable, the company you represent (collectively, "you") accept and
   agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms of
   use" or “Terms”).  It is important that you read these Terms as they
   form a legal agreement between you and LinkedIn, Inc. (“LinkedIn”,
   “we”, or “us”).

   In addition to the content in this document, the following are
   incorporated into the Terms  (and references to “Terms” shall mean this
   document and those incorporated by reference): (1) the LinkedIn User
   Agreement, which is located at
   [26]http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=user_agreement, (2) the LinkedIn
   Privacy Policy, which is located at
   [27]http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=privacy_policy, (3) the
   [28]Platform Guidelines, which are located at the LinkedIn Developer
   Network site at developer.linkedin.com (“Developer Site”), and (4) the
   [29]Branding Guidelines, which are located at the Developer Site.  In
   the event of any conflict between the content in this document and the
   documents incorporated by reference, this document shall control with
   respect to your use of the APIs.  If you disagree with anything in
   these Terms, do not click that you agree to them, and do not accept,
   access or use the APIs.

   LinkedIn reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice
   to you, to change these Terms in our sole and absolute discretion. The
   most current version of these Terms can be reviewed at this URL
   anytime. The most current version of the Terms will supersede all
   previous versions. By using the LinkedIn APIs after changes are made to
   the Terms you agree to be bound by such changes.  Your only recourse if
   you disagree with the Terms, or changes to the Terms, is to discontinue
   your use of the APIs.  As such, you should review the Terms
   periodically.

   1  Description, Licenses, and Restrictions

   1.1  Description of LinkedIn APIs. The APIs consist of programmatic web
   APIs and associated tools and documentation that allow you to create
   software application(s) or website(s) (your “Application,” which
   includes all components and content thereof) which will display certain
   data and content from the LinkedIn website at [30]www.linkedin.com
   (“Website”), as released from LinkedIn from time to time (the
   “Content”), subject to the limitations and conditions described herein.

   1.2  Developer Accounts and Access Codes.  In order to obtain the APIs,
   you must create a developer account. You will be issued one or more
   unique security keys, secrets, tokens, passwords and/or other
   credentials (collectively, “Access Codes”) for accessing the APIs and
   managing your account.  You may only access your account with the
   Access Code issued to you by LinkedIn.  Access may not always be
   available. You may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose
   your Access Codes to any other party or use them with any other
   Application other than that for which you initially applied for it. You
   may not modify or attempt to circumvent the Access Codes. You are
   responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your Access
   Codes. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur using
   your Access Codes, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken
   by you or a third party. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date
   and accurate information (including a current email address and other
   required contact information) for your account.  Failure to do so may
   jeopardize your continued access to the APIs.

   1.3  APIs License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions in these
   Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive non-assignable or
   transferable license under LinkedIn’s intellectual property rights
   during the Term to use the APIs to develop, test, and support your
   Application, and to distribute or allow access to your integration of
   the APIs within your Application to end users of your Application.  You
   have no right to distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs.

   1.4  Brand Features License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions
   of these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable
   or transferable license during the Term to display our trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, logos and domain names that we make
   available to you in our discretion via the Developer Site
   (collectively, “Brand Features”) to promote or advertise your
   integration of the APIs in your Application.  You agree that your use
   and display of the Brand Features will at all times be consistent with
   the Guidelines for Use of LinkedIn Brand Features, and any other
   branding, trademark, or similar guidelines included in the Platform
   Guidelines. In particular, you agree not to display our Brand Features
   in any way that is misleading, defamatory, infringing, libelous,
   disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable to LinkedIn, or in a
   way that suggests we have created, sponsored, or endorsed your
   Application or its content.

   1.5  Restrictions.  In addition to other restrictions contained in
   these Terms, you agree not to do any of the following, unless expressly
   permitted by LinkedIn in these Terms or in writing by LinkedIn:

   a.  Request or publish information impersonating a LinkedIn user,
   misrepresent any user or other third party in requesting or publishing
   information;

   obtained from another user’s LinkedIn network or through another user’s
   view of our Website or the Content;

   c.  Obtain, display or use more data through the APIs than is minimally
   required to run the Application created using the particular developer
   key;

   d.  Store LinkedIn user data other than the Member Token or OAuth Token
   for any LinkedIn member, with the exception of a user's profile data
   when given explicit permission by the owner of the profile as set forth
   in 3.4, below;

   e.  Use the APIs or Brand Features for any illegal, unauthorized or
   otherwise improper purposes, or in any manner which would violate these
   Terms (or any document incorporated into the Terms), or breach any laws
   or regulations, or violate any rights of third parties, in your use of
   the APIs;

   f.   Use the APIs in conjunction with, or combine content from the APIs
   with LinkedIn data obtained through scraping or any other means outside
   the official LinkedIn APIs.  This includes acquiring LinkedIn data from
   third parties;

   g.   Remove any legal, copyright, trademark, watermark or other
   proprietary rights notices contained in or on materials you receive or
   access pursuant to these Terms, including the APIs, the materials
   posted at the Developer Site, and our Website;

   h.  Sell, lease, share, transfer, sublicense or fail to protect the
   confidentiality of the APIs, Access Codes, or content posted or
   available in areas of the Developer Site that require Access Codes;

   i  Charge, directly or indirectly, any incremental fees (including any
   unique, specific, or premium charges) for access to LinkedIn’s Content
   or your integration of the APIs in your Application;

   j.  Use the Content in any advertisements or for purposes of targeting
   advertisements (whether such advertisement appear in your Application
   or elsewhere);

   k.  Submit content that falsely expresses or implies that such content
   is sponsored or endorsed by LinkedIn;

   l.  Use the Content for generating advertising, messages, promotions,
   offers, or for any other purpose other than, and solely to the extent
   necessary for, allowing end users to use the returned Content in your
   Application;

   m.   Copy, adapt, reformat, reverse-engineer, disassemble, decompile,
   translate or otherwise modify the APIs, Access Codes, our Website, our
   Content, or any of our other services;

   n.  Use the APIs in an Application that competes with products or
   services offered by us;

   o.  Interfere with or disrupt LinkedIn services or servers or networks
   connected to LinkedIn services, or disobey any requirements,
   procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to LinkedIn
   services;

   p.  Use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval Application, or other
   device to retrieve or index any portion of LinkedIn services or collect
   information about users for any unauthorized purpose;

   q.   Download, scrape, post, or transmit, in any form or by any means,
   and part of our Website or Content other than Content which you post as
   part of your Application;

   r.   Transmit any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, or any items
   of a destructive nature through your use of the APIs;

   s.   Use the APIs in an Application that contains or displays or
   promotes any of the following: spyware, adware, or other malicious
   programs or code, counterfeit goods, items subject to US embargo, hate
   materials (e.g. Nazi memorabilia) or materials urging acts of terrorism
   or violence, goods made from protected animal/plant species, recalled
   goods, any hacking, surveillance, interception, or descrambling
   equipment, illegal drugs and paraphernalia, unlicensed sale of
   prescription drugs and medical devices, the sale of tobacco or alcohol

   prostitution, body parts and bodily fluids, stolen products and items
   used for theft, fireworks, explosives, and hazardous materials,
   government IDs, police items, unlicensed trade or dealing in stocks and
   securities, gambling items, professional services regulated by state
   licensing regimes, non-transferable items such as airline tickets or
   event tickets, non-packaged food items, or weapons and accessories; or

   t.  Use the APIs for purposes where their failure could lead to death,
   personal injury, or severe property or environmental damage, including
   operating nuclear facilities, life support, or other mission critical
   applications where human life or property may be at stake.

   u.  Provide functionality that proxies, requests or collects LinkedIn
   user names or passwords.

   v.  Obfuscate or hide your deployment or use of any LinkedIn buttons,
   sign-in functionality, consent or authorization flows.

   1.6  Support and Modifications.  We may provide you with support or
   modifications for the APIs in our sole discretion.  We may terminate
   the provision of such support or modifications to you at any time
   without notice or liability to you.  We may release subsequent versions
   of the APIs and require that you use such subsequent versions. Your
   continued use of the APIs following a subsequent release will be deemed
   your acceptance of modifications.

   1.7  Fees.  The APIs are currently provided for free, but LinkedIn
   reserves the right to charge for the APIs in the future. If we do
   charge a fee for using the APIs or any feature thereof, you do not have
   any obligation to continue to use the APIs or the applicable feature.

   1.8  Monitoring.  You agree to provide us with access to your
   Application and/or other materials related to your use of the APIs as
   reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with these Terms.
   If, following the foregoing, LinkedIn is not satisfied that full
   compliance has been demonstrated, then, upon reasonable notice to you,
   LinkedIn may perform an audit of materials at your premises to verify
   your compliance with these Terms.  Such audit will be during regular
   business hours after no less than five business days notice. You agree
   that we may crawl or otherwise monitor your Applications and you agree
   not to block or interfere with such efforts by LinkedIn.

   1.9  Usage Limitations.  LinkedIn may limit the number of network calls
   that your Application may make via the APIs, and/or the maximum Content
   that may be accessed, or anything else about the APIs and the Content
   it accesses as LinkedIn deems appropriate in its sole discretion.  The
   usage limitations can be found in the LinkedIn developer portal at
   [31]http://developer.LinkedIn.com/.  LinkedIn may change such usage
   limits at any time.  In addition to its other rights under these Terms,
   LinkedIn may utilize technical measures to prevent overusage and/or
   stop usage of the APIs by an Application after any usage limitations
   are exceeded.  If no limits are stated in the Platform Guidelines, you
   nevertheless agree to use the APIs in a manner that, as determined by
   us in our sole discretion, exceeds reasonable request volume or
   constitutes excessive or abusive usage.

   1.10   Security Measures.  Your networks, operating system and the
   software of your web server(s), routers, databases, and computer
   systems (collectively, “System” or “Systems”) must be properly
   configured to Internet industry standards as required to securely
   operate your Application.  You will not architect or select Systems in
   a manner to avoid the foregoing obligation. You must promptly report
   any security deficiencies in or intrusions to your Systems that you
   discover to LinkedIn in writing via email to [32]support@linkedin.com
   or subsequent contact information posted in the Developer Site. You
   will work with LinkedIn to immediately correct any security deficiency,
   and will disconnect immediately any intrusions or intruder. In the
   event of security deficiency or intrusion involving the Application,
   you will make no public statements (i.e. press, blogs, bulletin boards,
   etc.) without prior written and express permission from LinkedIn in
   each instance.

   1.11    LinkedIn Independent Development.  You understand and
   acknowledge that LinkedIn may be independently creating applications,
   content and other products or services that may be similar to or
   competitive with your Application, and nothing in these Terms will be
   construed as restricting or preventing LinkedIn from creating and fully
   exploiting such applications, content and other items, without any
   obligation to you.

   2  Proprietary Rights

   2.1  LinkedIn Property.  As between you and us, we own all rights,
   title, and interest, including without limitation all intellectual
   property rights, in and to,  the (i) APIs, and all elements,
   components, and executables of the APIs; (ii) the Content available
   from the APIs; (iii) our Website; and (iv) our Brand Features
   (collectively, the “LinkedIn Materials”).   Except for the express
   licenses granted in these Terms, LinkedIn does not grant you any right,
   title or interest in the LinkedIn Materials.  You agree to take such
   actions, including, without limitation, execution of affidavits or
   other documents, as LinkedIn may reasonably request to effect, perfect
   or confirm LinkedIn’s rights to the LinkedIn Materials.

   2.2     Feedback. You have no obligation to give us any suggestions,
   comments or other feedback (“Feedback”) relating to the LinkedIn
   Materials.  However, we may use and include any Feedback that you
   voluntarily provide to improve the LinkedIn Materials and/or any other
   of our products, services or technologies.   Accordingly, if you give
   Feedback, you agree that we may freely use, reproduce, license, and
   distribute such Feedback.  You also agree not to provide Feedback that
   you know is subject to any intellectual property claim by a third party
   or any license terms which would require products or services derived
   from such Feedback to be licensed to or from, or shared with, any third
   party.

   2.3  Application.  You represent and warrant to LinkedIn that,
   excluding LinkedIn Property, you have the right to use, reproduce,
   transmit, copy, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your
   Application, and that use by LinkedIn and its users of your Application
   shall not violate the rights of any third party (e.g., copyright,
   patent, trademark, or other proprietary right of any person or entity),
   or any applicable regulation or law, including the laws of any country
   in which your Application is made available. Except to the extent your
   Application contains LinkedIn Property, LinkedIn claims no ownership or
   control over your Application.  During the term of these Terms you
   hereby grant to us a paid-up, royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide
   irrevocable right and license, under all of your intellectual property
   rights, to: (i) use, perform, and display, your Application and its
   content for purposes of marketing, demonstrating, and making your
   Application available to users; (ii) link to and direct users to your
   Application; and (iii) sublicense the foregoing rights to our
   affiliates.   Following the termination of these Terms and upon written
   request from you, LinkedIn shall make commercially reasonable efforts,
   as determined in its sole discretion, to remove all references and
   links to your Application from the LinkedIn website and service.
   LinkedIn shall have no other obligation to delete copies of, references
   to, or links to, your Application.

   3  Privacy, Policies, and Legal Compliance

   3.1  LinkedIn’s Privacy Policy.  LinkedIn’s collection and use of
   personal information from its users and developers is governed by
   LinkedIn's Privacy Policy, available at
   [33]http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=privacy_policy and incorporated
   by reference into these Terms, with the exception that LinkedIn may
   reveal personal information about developers for attribution purposes,
   handling inquiries from users or potential users, and other purposes
   LinkedIn reasonably deems necessary pursuant to these Terms. You
   understand and agree that LinkedIn may access, preserve, and disclose
   your personal information and your developer account details if
   required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access,
   preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with
   legal process or protect the rights, property and/or safety of
   LinkedIn, its affiliates or partners, its users, or the general public.

   3.2  Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You will post a policy complying
   with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and respond promptly
   to notices of alleged copyright infringement involving your
   Application.

   3.3  Your Policies; Informed Consent.  You will (a) maintain your own
   user agreement and privacy policy applicable to users of the
   Application (your “Policies”), (b) comply with your Policies, (c)
   prominently identify and link to your Policies at those locations where
   users opt may download or access your Application, and (d) promptly
   notify us of any breaches of your Policies by you or by users of the
   Application. Your privacy policy will be at least as stringent and
   user-friendly as LinkedIn’s. Before obtaining information from Your
   users of the Application, You will obtain their informed consent by
   informing them what information You collect and how it will be used
   and/or shared.

   3.4  Data Storage and Conversion Limits. You may not copy, store or
   cache any Content returned or received through the APIs, including data
   about users, longer than the current usage session of the user for
   which it was obtained, except for the alphanumeric user IDs (Member
   Tokens) we provide you for identifying users and their authentication
   token (OAuth Token). You may store the Member Token and the OAuth Token
   until you cease using the APIs, until the LinkedIn user uninstalls your
   application or directs you to delete his information,  or unless we
   terminate your use them for breach of these Terms. The restrictions of
   this Section do not apply to user profile data received through the
   APIs that a user explicitly permits you to collect and store, provided
   that you obtain the user’s consent through the technical and
   user-interface specifications provided by LinkedIn. However, user
   profile data does not include information about a user’s connections,
   which may not be copied or stored. You must , and delete all the data
   collected with the user’s consent either upon request by the user, when
   the user uninstalls your Application or closes his or her account with
   you. The restrictions of this Section also do not apply to “Independent
   Data,” which means data that users provide directly to you and that is
   separately entered, uploaded, or presented to you by the user of your
   Application.

   4  Marketing and Publicity

   4.1  Your Marketing and Publicity.  You may promote your Application,
   including talking to traditional and online media and your users about
   your Application, so long as you do so truthfully and without implying
   that your Application is created or endorsed by LinkedIn (or otherwise
   embellishing your relationship with LinkedIn).  However, you may not
   issue any formal press release via traditional or online media without
   LinkedIn’s prior consent, unless expressly allowed in the Guidelines
   for Use of LinkedIn Brand Features.

   4.2  LinkedIn’s Marketing and Publicity.  We may publicly refer to you,
   orally or in writing, as a licensee of the LinkedIn APIs and we may
   publish your name and/or logo (with or without a link to your
   Application) on our Website, in press releases, and in promotional
   materials without your prior consent.

   5  Confidentiality

   The term "LinkedIn Confidential Information” means any information of
   or relating to LinkedIn that becomes known to you through disclosure,
   observation or otherwise, and that either is designated as confidential
   by LinkedIn or that is not generally known or readily ascertainable to
   the public, including, without limitation, nonpublic information
   regarding LinkedIn’s APIs and LinkedIn's products, services, programs,
   features, data, techniques, technology, code, ideas, inventions,
   research, testing, methods, procedures, know-how, trade secrets,
   business and financial information and other activities. All LinkedIn
   Confidential Information remains the property of LinkedIn, and no
   license or other right in any LinkedIn Confidential Information is
   granted hereby. You will not disclose any LinkedIn Confidential
   Information to any third party, and will take all reasonable
   precautions to prevent its unauthorized dissemination, both during and
   after the term of these Terms. If you are a corporate entity, you will
   limit your internal distribution of LinkedIn Confidential Information
   to your employees and agents who have a need to know, and will take
   steps to ensure that dissemination is so limited. You will not use any
   LinkedIn Confidential Information for the benefit of anyone other than
   LinkedIn.  Upon LinkedIn's written request, you will destroy or return
   to LinkedIn all LinkedIn Confidential Information in your custody or
   control. In addition to the terms of this provision, you and LinkedIn
   will continue to be subject to any non-disclosure agreement that you
   and LinkedIn have entered into separately.  This provision will survive
   any termination of these Terms.

   6  Term and Termination

   6.1  Term.  The term of these Terms of Use shall commence on the date
   upon which you agree to the Terms and shall continue in force
   thereafter, unless modified or terminated as provided herein.

   6.2  LinkedIn Termination; Suspension; Discontinuance. We may suspend
   or terminate your use of all or any of the APIs at any time if we
   believe you have violated these Terms, the User Agreement, the Platform
   Guidelines, or, in our sole discretion, we believe the availability of
   the APIs in your Application is not in our or our users’ best
   interests. We may discontinue the availability of some or all of the
   APIs at any time for any reason.    We may also impose limits on
   certain features and services or restrict your access to some or all of
   the APIs or our Website. All of our rights herein may be exercised
   without prior notice or liability to you.

   6.3   Your Termination.  You may terminate the agreement under these
   Terms for any reason or no reason at all, at your convenience, by
   closing your account or ceasing use of the APIs.

   6.4   Effect of Termination.  Upon termination of the agreement between
   us under these Terms, (a) all rights and licenses granted to you will
   terminate immediately, (b) any and all payment obligations, if any,
   will be due, (c) you will promptly destroy LinkedIn Confidential
   Information in your possession or control, and (d) unless we agree
   otherwise in writing or as stated in these Terms, you must permanently
   delete all Content or other data which you stored pursuant to your use
   of the APIs, except as expressly permitted by these Terms of the
   Platform Guidelines.  LinkedIn may request that you certify in writing
   your compliance with this Section.  No liability shall be created for
   either party by the mere fact of termination of the agreement under
   these Terms.  The following Sections of these Terms shall survive
   termination: Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.11, 2, 3, and 5-10.

   6.5   Remedies. You acknowledge that your breach of these Terms may
   cause irreparable harm to LinkedIn, the extent of which would be
   difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, you agree that, in addition to any
   other remedies to which LinkedIn may be legally entitled, LinkedIn
   shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event
   of a breach of these Terms by you or any of your officers, employees,
   consultants or other agents.

   9  Indemnification

   You agree to hold harmless and indemnify LinkedIn, and its affiliates,
   and their respective directors, officers, agents, and employees,
   advertisers or partners, from and against any third party claim arising
   from or in any way related to your use of any LinkedIn Materials,
   violation of these Terms of Use or any other actions connected with
   your use of the LinkedIn APIs, including any liability or expense
   arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential),
   suits, judgments, litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, of
   every kind and nature.

   10.     General Terms

   10.1   Governing Law; Attorneys Fees.  These Terms will be governed by
   and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California as
   such laws apply to contracts between California residents performed
   entirely within California.  Any action or proceeding arising from or
   relating to these Terms must be brought in a federal court in the
   Northern District of California or in state court in Santa Clara
   County, California and each party irrevocably submits to the
   jurisdiction and venue of any such court.  In the event of litigation
   between the parties arising out of or related to these Terms, the
   prevailing party will be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and
   costs incurred.

   10.2   Interpretation.  .  The term “include” (and all of its variants)
   when used in these Terms will be interpreted to be followed by the
   clause “without limitation” in all cases.  You agree that LinkedIn has
   sole discretion in determining the interpretation of the meaning of
   these Terms, including determining your compliance with these Terms.

   10.3   Export Laws.  You shall comply with applicable export laws and
   regulations of the United States with respect to any technical
   materials you receive pursuant to these Terms.

   10.4   Waiver. The failure of LinkedIn to exercise or enforce any right
   or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right
   or provision.
