   removed support for SSLv3, effective immediately. If you are
   experiencing errors related to HTTPS-based communication with our APIs,
   please ensure you are using a client/library that supports TLS 1.0+
   instead of SSLv3 to avoid disruption. Attention, developers! We have
   transitioned to StackOverflow for forum-based support. [32]Learn more

LinkedIn APIs Terms of Use

   Oct 22, 2009 — LIDeveloperAdmin

   We’re excited that you’ve chosen to develop on the LinkedIn platform.
   At LinkedIn, we believe in putting our members first. We created our
   developer program to enable developers to create fantastic applications
   for our members. Together, we are building the professional web.

   Note: You are entering into a legally binding agreement.

   Last revised on June 18, 2014.

1. Introduction

   About us and these API Terms of Use

   You agree that by using our developer platform, you are entering into a
   legally binding agreement with LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin
   Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA and LinkedIn Ireland
   Limited, Gardner House, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland
   (“we,” “us,” “our,” and “LinkedIn”). By registering for an account (a
   “Developer Account”) at the LinkedIn Developer Network site at
   developer.linkedin.com (the “Developer Site”), you acknowledge that you
   have read and understood and agree to be bound by these LinkedIn API
   Terms of Use (the “Terms”). If you are using our developer platform on
   behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you
   have full legal authority to register for a Developer Account on behalf
   of that entity and bind it to these Terms. If you are not authorized,
   you may not accept the Terms or register for a Developer Account for
   someone else.

   These Terms will evolve, so please check back regularly. It is your
   responsibility to remain informed of these Terms.
    1. Purpose
       The mission of LinkedIn is to connect the world’s professionals to
       enable them to be more productive and successful. To achieve our
       mission, we make APIs available to third party developers such as
       you to create applications for our members and customers.
    2. Scope and Intent
       The LinkedIn Developer Program includes a self-service platform
       program, where you can develop applications using LinkedIn’s APIs
       as soon as you register for a Developer Account and agree to follow
       these Terms, and a “Platform Partner Program,” where you can apply
       to develop applications if they meet our Platform Partner Program
       eligibility criteria and you have entered into a signed partnership
       agreement with LinkedIn.
       As used in these Terms, “APIs” means programmatic web APIs and
       associated tools and documentation that LinkedIn provides, and
       “Application” means a software application, website, or product you
       create or a service you offer.
       Here are the guidelines to determine which of LinkedIn’s developer
       programs fits your Application:
         1. Self-Service Program
            You may use our self-service program if you are developing an
            Application designed to help LinkedIn members be more
            productive and successful across the web; for example, by
            augmenting their profile and professional brand in an
            Application for publishing, discussing and sharing content
            with like-minded professionals and by applying for a job on a
            company’s career site.
            You cannot use our self-service program and must talk to us
            directly, as you may be subject to additional Terms, if your
            Application:
               o is expected to:
                    # have more than 250,000 lifetime members; or
                    # make more than 500,000 daily calls to a LinkedIn
                      API; or
                    # make more than 500,000 lifetime people search calls
                      to a LinkedIn API; or
                    # serve greater than 1 million daily plug-in
                      impressions; or
               o relies on access to APIs as a fundamental aspect of your
                 business.
               o will store or export any data from LinkedIn other than a
                 LinkedIn member’s profile data (name, photo, headline,
                 contact information, experience, education, summary, and
                 location). This includes data for anyone other than the
                 member who requested the data, such as profile or other
                 data about the member’s connections; network updates;
                 search results generated using LinkedIn data; and
                 information about companies and job postings.
         2. Partner Program
            You must apply to our Platform Partner Program and cannot use
            our self-service program if your Application targets current
            or potential paying customers of LinkedIn products or people
            engaging in activities related to those products—in other
            words, Applications used for hiring, marketing, or selling.
            Here are some examples of what we mean by hiring, marketing
            and selling:
               o Hiring: Applications to find a job or fill a job, such as
                 ones used to advertise, post, apply for, search for,
                 recommend, refer, suggest, enhance listings for, or fill
                 permanent jobs, contract positions, or volunteer
                 opportunities, or for anything with a similar
                 functionality. (You can however use our self-service
                 program for building an Application to let people apply
                 for a job on a company’s career site, as long as it
                 abides by the specification at
                 [33]https://developer.linkedin.com/apply-with-linkedin.)
               o Marketing: Applications used by marketers or their
                 customers for marketing campaigns, lead generation,
                 campaign analysis, or for anything with similar
                 functionality. (You can however use our self-service
                 program for building an Application to let companies
                 manage their social media presence on LinkedIn, as long
                 as it abides by Section 3.B.5. below (“Social Media
                 Management: Company Profile and Statistics Data”).)
               o Selling: Applications used by sales or other outbound
                 professionals for generating or finding prospects or
                 leads, for sales intelligence or training, for
                 relationship management, for systematic matching of
                 individuals with their LinkedIn profiles, or for anything
                 with similar functionality.
            For more information about the Platform Partner Program
            application process, eligibility criteria and the areas where
            we are looking for partners visit
            [34]https://developer.linkedin.com/partner-programs.

2. Joining our Self-Service Program

    1. Developer Accounts and Access Credentials
         1. Developer Account
            To use our self-service APIs, you must first sign up for a
            Developer Account using your real LinkedIn member account.
            Both the Developer Account and your LinkedIn member account
            must contain accurate and up-to-date information at all times,
            including your current title, company, and e-mail address. You
            agree that we can use, store, and share information submitted
            by you through your Developer Account as permitted in our
            Privacy Policy.
         2. Access Credentials
            Once you have a Developer Account you may obtain Access
            Credentials for your Application. “Access Credentials” means
            the necessary security keys, secrets, tokens, passwords, and
            other credentials to access the APIs. The Access Credentials
            enable us to associate your API activity with your Application
            and the members using it. All activities that occur using your
            Access Credentials are your responsibility. Keep them secret.
            Do not sell, transfer, or sublicense them. Do not try to
            circumvent them. And do not require your users to obtain their
            own Access Credentials to use your Application.
         3. Test Account
            You may create up to five LinkedIn test accounts for testing
            purposes only. You must create the accounts manually and not
            via any automated means, such as scripts. These test accounts
            must not interact with non-test accounts (for example, you
            can’t use test accounts to post messages in Groups), or
            override our API user limits. You must clearly identify the
            accounts as test accounts in the applicable account profile,
            and must identify these additional account profiles as
            “Developers” in your Developer Account. You may not create any
            profile positions at real companies (besides your own) through
            the test accounts.
         4. API License
            As long as you follow these Terms, we grant you a limited,
            non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable license under
            LinkedIn’s intellectual property rights to use the APIs to
            develop, test, and support your Application, and to let your
            customers use your integration of the APIs within your
            Application.
         5. Plugins
            The use of our plugins is subject to the terms of our Plugins
            Terms of Use. If you use both APIs and LinkedIn plugins in
            your Application, you must comply with both these Terms and
            the Plugins Terms of Use.

3. Act Professionally

    1. Display and Use Content Properly
         1. Data Views
            People’s views of their LinkedIn networks are private to them,
            based on the connections they have. Each user must give you
            express permission to access their LinkedIn account and
            network through your Application, and you must provide the
            user’s account and network information only to that user and
            no one else. In addition, your Application must not permit
            users to share their networks or data about their networks to
            anyone else.
         2. Excluded Uses
            You must never do any of the following under these Terms:
              1. Use LinkedIn Content in any advertisements or for
                 purposes of targeting advertisements, in your Application
                 or elsewhere. “Content” means any data or content from
                 our Website or accessed via the APIs. Our “Website” means
                 LinkedIn’s website at www.linkedin.com and any other
                 website owned or operated by LinkedIn.
              2. Use the Content for any of the following: generating
                 messages, promotions, offers, or mass messages; or for
                 any other purpose other than to allow end users to use
                 the Content in your Application. This includes using the
                 Content to send a mass message to users asking them to
                 interact with each other, such as to rate each other.
              3. Use the APIs in any Application that includes adult
                 content, promotes gambling, involves the sale of tobacco
                 or alcohol to persons under 21 years of age, or otherwise
                 violates any law or regulation.
              4. Sell, lease, share, transfer, or sublicense any Content
                 or access to any Content, directly or indirectly, to
                 anybody. That includes data brokers, salespeople,
                 advertisers, social or professional networks, recruiters,
                 or anyone besides yourself or the company on whose behalf
                 you agreed to these Terms.
              5. Use the APIs to retrieve Content mingled with third party
                 search results (i.e., aggregated search results).
              6. Commingle or supplement Content from the APIs with any
                 other LinkedIn data. For example, you cannot supplement
                 the data you have received via a LinkedIn API with data
                 scraped from our Website (whether that scraping was done
                 by you or someone else) or from any other source.
              7. Use someone’s Access Credentials to show his or her
                 Content to someone else, e.g., as part of search results.
                 Each user must authenticate individually to retrieve his
                 or her Content through the APIs.
              8. Distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs to
                 anyone other than the company on whose behalf you agreed
                 to these Terms, or create an API that enables access to
                 LinkedIn Content. Anyone who wants to access our APIs and
                 Content must register for our Developer Program.
    2. Store Content Only As Allowed
         1. No Storing Any Content
            You must not copy or store any Content or capture or store any
            information expressed by the Content (such as hashed or
            transformed data), except to the extent permitted by these
            Terms.
         2. You May Store Tokens
            You may store the alphanumeric user IDs (Member Tokens) that
            we provide to you for identifying users or any individual
            member’s authentication token (OAuth Token) that we provide to
            you when a LinkedIn user authenticates your Application to his
            LinkedIn account.
         3. Cache for Performance
            To improve the member experience, you may cache the Content
            for up to 24 hours from a request for that Content through the
            API. This limited permission to cache is for performance
            reasons only. You do not have any rights to store the LinkedIn
            Content beyond this limited 24-hour period.
         4. Member Profile Data
            You may store a user’s Profile Data if you have the consent of
            the user to do so, for example, so that a user applying for a
            job at your company can provide you with a copy of their
            profile. “Profile Data” means the name, photo, headline,
            contact information, experience, education, summary, and
            location of a LinkedIn member. Profile Data excludes
            connections, network updates, job listings, groups, companies,
            and any other Content. The process for obtaining member
            consent must meet our specifications set forth at
            [35]https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/specifications-ob
            taining-consent-store-profile-data. If you want to refresh the
            user’s Profile Data, you may only do so when the user is
            actually using your application and not on an automated
            schedule. You must use stored Profile Data solely for the
            benefit of the LinkedIn user that granted you permission to
            access it, for example, to evaluate that user for a position
            in your company. You must not monetize it, directly or
            indirectly. For example, you may not sell or otherwise provide
            access to an aggregated collection of profiles or the most
            relevant people for a position.
         5. Social Media Management: Company Profile and Statistics Data
            You may store company page status updates, analytics on
            company page status updates, company follower analytics data,
            and text content of comments on company status updates
            received via the Company Share API (“Company Profile and
            Statistics Data”) on behalf of your company. Company Profile
            and Statistics Data excludes any personal information tied to
            users who posted comments on any company page. You must not
            commingle the Company Profile and Statistics Data with any of
            your data or with data belonging to any third party.
            In addition, as long as you let your clients know that you are
            storing Company Profile Statistics Data for them, you may
            store Company Profile and Statistics Data for them. However,
            as soon as your client stops receiving LinkedIn Content
            through your Application, you must permanently delete the
            client’s Company Profile and Statistics Data in 10 days or
            less. Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, you must
            permanently delete all Company Profile and Statistics Data for
            all clients.
         6. Protection of Stored Data
            You must use commercially reasonable security measures to
            protect the confidentiality of all stored data, which measures
            are at least as secure as those you use to protect your own
            confidential information. The stored data must not be
            transferred or provided to any third parties. LinkedIn may
            require that you certify that you have deleted stored data.
    3. Delete Content When Asked
         1. Delete at User Request
            You must delete all data collected with the user’s consent,
            including the Member Token and the OAuth Token, upon request
            by the user, when the user uninstalls your Application, or
            when the user closes his or her account with you. The
            restrictions of this Section 3.C.1 do not apply to data that
            users provide directly to you and that is separately entered
            or uploaded to you by the user of your Application. You must
            delete all Company Profile and Statistics Data collected with
            your client's consent within 10 days of receiving a request
            from your client.
         2. Delete for Breach
            You must immediately delete all data if we terminate your use
            of the APIs for breach of these Terms, except when doing so
            would cause you to violate any law or obligation imposed by a
            governmental authority.
    4. Don’t Harm or Trick Members
         1. Your Application must include your own user agreement and
            privacy policy. Your user agreement and privacy policy must be
            prominently identified or located where users download or
            access your Application. You must promptly notify us of any
            breaches of your user agreement or privacy policy that impact
            or may impact our members. Your privacy policy must be at
            least as stringent and user-friendly as LinkedIn’s.
            Before obtaining information from your users of the
            Application, you must obtain their informed consent by
            informing them what information you collect and how it will be
            used and/or shared.
            Your Application must not:
               o Implement features or business practices that harm the
                 professional reputation, relationships, or professional
                 ecosystem of LinkedIn members.
               o Impersonate a LinkedIn user or misrepresent any user or
                 other third party when requesting or publishing
                 information.
               o Obfuscate or hide any LinkedIn buttons, sign-in
                 functionality, consent, or authorization flows from your
                 users. In order to access member-specific Content through
                 the APIs, your users must sign-in with their LinkedIn
                 credentials and grant your Application access to their
                 Content.
               o Proxy, request, or use LinkedIn user names or passwords
                 in any fashion for any reason. We want our members to
                 have safe and consistent experiences across all
                 Applications.
    5. Be a Good Citizen to our Platform
         1. When you use the LinkedIn APIs, you share LinkedIn with your
            fellow LinkedIn members and developers. Write your Application
            as you’d want others to write theirs.
               o Only ask for the minimum data fields your Application
                 needs.
               o Don’t try to exceed or circumvent your limitations on
                 calls and use. This includes creating multiple
                 Applications for identical, or largely similar, usage
                 (e.g., having one Application per customer). If we
                 believe that you have exceeded or circumvented our
                 limitations, or if you have tried to, we may temporarily
                 suspend or permanently block your access to the APIs,
                 disable your developer account, or both.
               o Don’t download, scrape, post, or transmit, in any form or
                 by any means, any part of our Website. This includes data
                 retrieved by web browser plugins.
               o Don’t copy, reformat, reverse-engineer, or otherwise
                 modify the APIs, Access Credentials, our Website or any
                 Content.
               o Don’t interfere with or disrupt LinkedIn services or
                 servers or networks connected to LinkedIn services, or
                 disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or
                 regulations of networks connected to LinkedIn services.
    6. Treat Our Brand With Respect
         1. Brand Features License
            Subject to these Terms, including the [36]Branding Guidelines,
            we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable,
            non-sublicenseable, and non-transferable license during the
            Term to display our Brand Features to promote or advertise
            your integration of the APIs in your Application. “Brand
            Features” means any trade names, trademarks, service marks,
            logos and domain names that LinkedIn makes available to you.
         2. Restrictions.
            You must not:
              1. Display our Brand Features in any way that is misleading,
                 defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene,
                 or otherwise objectionable to LinkedIn in its sole
                 discretion, or in a way that suggests we have created,
                 sponsored, or endorsed your Application or its content;
              2. Remove any legal, copyright, trademark, watermark or
                 other proprietary rights notices contained in or on
                 materials you receive or access pursuant to these Terms,
                 including the APIs, the materials posted at the Developer
                 Site, and our Website; or
              3. Use the APIs or Brand Features for any illegal,
                 unauthorized or otherwise improper purposes, or in any
                 manner that would violate these Terms (or any document
                 incorporated into the Terms), or breach any laws or
                 regulations, or violate any rights of third parties, or
                 expose LinkedIn or its members to legal liability in your
                 use of the APIs.
         3. Publicity by You
            Subject to our Branding Guidelines, you may promote your
            Application, including talking to traditional and online media
            and your users about your Application, so long as you do so
            truthfully and without implying that your Application is
            created or endorsed by LinkedIn (or otherwise embellishing
            your relationship with LinkedIn). However, you may not issue
            any formal press release via traditional or online media
            referring to LinkedIn without LinkedIn’s prior consent, unless
            expressly allowed in the Branding Guidelines.
         4. Publicity by Us
            We may publicly refer to you, orally or in writing, as a
            licensee of the LinkedIn APIs. We may also publish your name
            and logo (with or without a link to your Application) on our
            Website, in press releases, and in promotional materials
            without your prior consent.
    7. Follow The Law and These Terms
       You must comply with all applicable laws, including, the Digital
       Millennium Copyright Act and applicable export laws, and these
       Terms, which may be amended from time to time with or without
       advance notice, in order to use the LinkedIn APIs. You and your
       Application must also comply with the following, which are hereby
       incorporated by reference:
          + [37]The LinkedIn User Agreement;
          + [38]The LinkedIn Privacy Policy;
          + [39]The Platform Guidelines, which are located at the
            Developer Site; and
          + [40]The Branding Guidelines.
       In the event of any conflict between the content in this document
       and the above documents, this document controls your use of the
       APIs. If you disagree with any of the provisions in these Terms, do
       not access or use the APIs.
       The most current version of these Terms can be reviewed on the
       Developer Site. By using the LinkedIn APIs after changes are made
       to the Terms, you agree to be bound by the most current version. If
       you disagree with the Terms, or changes to the Terms, you must
       discontinue your use of the APIs.
       If we have entered into a separate, written API License Agreement
       with you, the terms of that agreement will govern your use of those
       APIs.

4. Safety and Abuse

    1. Security Measures
       Your network, operating system and the software of your web
       servers, databases, and computer systems (collectively, “Systems”)
       must be properly configured to securely operate your Application.
       You must not architect or select Systems in a manner to avoid the
       foregoing obligation. You must promptly report any security
       deficiencies in or intrusions to your Systems that you discover to
       LinkedIn in writing via email to security@linkedin.com or
       subsequent contact information posted in the Developer Site. You
       will work with LinkedIn to immediately correct any security
       deficiency, and will disconnect immediately any intrusions or
       intruder. In the event of any security deficiency or intrusion
       involving the Application, you will make no public statements (e.g.
       press, blogs, social media, bulletin boards, etc.) without prior
       written and express permission from LinkedIn in each instance.
    2. Monitoring
       You agree to assist LinkedIn in verifying your compliance with
       these Terms by providing information about your Application to us,
       which may also include access to your Application and other
       materials related to your use of the APIs. If you do not
       demonstrate full compliance with these Terms, we may restrict or
       terminate your access to the APIs.

5. Rights We Reserve

    1. Support and Modifications
       We may provide you with support or modifications for the APIs in
       our sole discretion. We may stop providing support or modifications
       to you at any time without notice or liability to you. We may
       release subsequent versions of the APIs and require that you use
       those subsequent versions. Your continued use of the APIs following
       a subsequent release will be deemed your acceptance of
       modifications.
    2. Fees
       The APIs are currently provided for free, but LinkedIn reserves the
       right to charge for the APIs in the future. If we do charge a fee
       for use of the APIs or any developer tools and features, you do not
       have any obligation to continue to use LinkedIn’s developer
       resources.
    3. LinkedIn Independent Development
       You understand and acknowledge that LinkedIn may be independently
       creating applications, content, and other products or services that
       may be similar to or competitive with your Application. Nothing in
       these Terms will be construed as restricting or preventing LinkedIn
       from creating and fully exploiting any applications, content, and
       other items, without any obligation to you.
    4. Developer Exception to our Privacy Policy
       LinkedIn may reveal personal information about developers for
       attribution purposes, handling inquiries from users or potential
       users, and other purposes LinkedIn reasonably deems necessary under
       these Terms. You understand and agree that LinkedIn may access,
       preserve, and disclose your personal information and your developer
       account details if required to do so by law or in a good faith
       belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably
       necessary to comply with legal process or to protect the rights,
       property, or safety of LinkedIn, its affiliates or partners, its
       users, or the general public.

6. Ownership

    1. LinkedIn Property
       As between you and us, we own all rights, title, and interest,
       including all intellectual property rights, in and to, the (a)
       APIs, and all elements, components, and executables of the APIs;
       (b) the Content available through the APIs; (c) our Website; and
       (d) our Brand Features (clauses (a)-(d) collectively, the “LinkedIn
       Materials”). Except for the express licenses granted in these
       Terms, LinkedIn does not grant you any right, title, or interest in
       the LinkedIn Materials. You agree to take such actions, including
       executing affidavits or other documents, as LinkedIn may reasonably
       request to effect, perfect, or confirm LinkedIn’s rights to the
       LinkedIn Materials.
    2. Your Property
         1. Contributions to LinkedIn
            By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding the
            LinkedIn Materials ("Contributions") in any way to LinkedIn,
            you acknowledge and agree that: (a) your Contributions do not
            contain confidential or proprietary information; (b) LinkedIn
            is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or
            implied, with respect to the Contributions; (c) LinkedIn shall
            be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or
            disclose) such Contributions for any purpose, in any way, in
            any media worldwide; (d) LinkedIn may have something similar
            to the Contributions already under consideration or in
            development; (e) you irrevocably non-exclusively license to
            LinkedIn rights to exploit your Contributions; and (f) you are
            not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind
            from LinkedIn under any circumstances.
         2. Your Application
            You represent and warrant to LinkedIn that, excluding LinkedIn
            Materials, you have the right to use, reproduce, transmit,
            copy, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your
            Application, and that use by LinkedIn and its users of your
            Application will not violate the rights of any third party
            (e.g., copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary
            right of any person or entity), or any applicable regulation
            or law, including the laws of any country in which your
            Application is made available. Except to the extent your
            Application contains LinkedIn Materials, LinkedIn claims no
            ownership or control over your Application. During the term of
            these Terms you hereby grant to us a paid-up, royalty-free,
            non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable right and license, under
            all of your intellectual property rights, to: (a) use,
            perform, and display your Application and its content for
            purposes of marketing, demonstrating, and making your
            Application available to users; (b) link to and direct users
            to your Application; and (c) sublicense the foregoing rights
            to our affiliates. Following the termination of these Terms
            and upon written request from you, LinkedIn will make
            commercially reasonable efforts, as determined in its sole
            discretion, to remove all references and links to your
            Application from the Website and service. LinkedIn has no
            other obligation to delete copies of, references to, or links
            to your Application.

7. Term and Termination

    1. Term
       The term of these Terms will commence on the date upon which you
       agree to these Terms and will continue until: you discontinue using
       our APIs, you close your Developer Account, or we terminate your
       access to the APIs, these Terms, or both.
         1. Suspension; Termination
            We may suspend or terminate your use of all or any of the APIs
            at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms or, if
            we believe the availability of the APIs in your Application is
            not in our or our members’ best interests. We may discontinue
            the availability of some or all of the APIs at any time for
            any reason. We may also impose limits on certain features and
            services or restrict your access to some or all of the APIs or
            our Website. All of our rights in these Terms may be exercised
            without prior notice or liability to you.
         2. Effect of Termination
            Upon termination of the agreement between you and us under
            these Terms:
              1. all rights and licenses granted to you will terminate
                 immediately;
              2. you will promptly destroy LinkedIn confidential
                 information in your possession or control;
              3. neither party is liable to the other party just because
                 these Terms have been terminated; and
              4. unless we agree otherwise in writing or as stated in
                 these Terms, you must permanently delete all Content or
                 other data which you stored pursuant to your use of the
                 APIs. LinkedIn may request that you certify in writing
                 your compliance with this section.
         3. Survival
            The terms of this Agreement shall survive any termination,
            except Section 2 (“Joining our Self-Service Program”),
            subsections 2-5 of Section 3.B. (“Store Content Only as
            Allowed”), subsections 1, 2, and 4 of Section 3.F. (“Treat Our
            Brand With Respect”) and Section 4.A. (“Security Measures”).

   AND FOR ANY OTHER REASON.

9. Limitation of Liability

   SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN
   CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION
   MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Neither LinkedIn nor any of our subsidiaries,
   affiliated companies, suppliers, employees, shareholders, or directors
   (“LinkedIn Affiliates”) shall be cumulatively liable for any special,
   incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use,
   profit, revenue or data to you or any third person arising from your
   use of LinkedIn materials accessed through or downloaded from LinkedIn.
   This limitation of liability shall:
     * Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract,
       tort, statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have
       known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited
       remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose;
       and
     * Not apply to any damage that LinkedIn may cause you intentionally
       or knowingly in violation of these Terms or applicable law, or as
       otherwise mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed in
       these Terms.
     * Not apply if you have entered into a separate agreement to license
       a LinkedIn API(s) with a separate Limitation of Liability provision
       that supersedes this section in relation to that particular
       LinkedIn API(s).

10. Dispute Resolution

    1. Law and Forum for Legal Disputes
       These Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute (“claim”)
       arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the
       laws of the state of California, United States, regardless of your
       country of origin or where you access LinkedIn, and notwithstanding
       of any conflicts of law principles and the United Nations
       Convention for the International Sale of Goods. You and LinkedIn
       agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms must
       be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in
       Santa Clara County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the
       parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below.
       You and LinkedIn agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
       the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the
       purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding the above,
       you agree that LinkedIn shall still be allowed to apply for
       injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief)
       in any jurisdiction.
    2. Arbitration Option
       For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
       relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than
       $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the
       dispute in a cost effective manner through binding
       non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects
       arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an
       established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider
       mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the
       parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration
       shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on
       written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the
       party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not
       involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
       otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on
       the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be
       entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

11. General Terms

   Here are some important details about how to read these Terms.
    1. Severability
       If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent
       jurisdiction or arbitrator to be illegal, void, or unenforceable,
       the unenforceable provision will be modified so as to render it
       enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in order
       to effect the intention of the provision; if a court or arbitrator
       finds the modified provision invalid, illegal, void or
       unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
       remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected in any
       way.
    2. Language
       Where LinkedIn has provided you with a translation of the English
       language version of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any other
       documentation, you agree that the translation is provided for your
       convenience only and that the English language versions of these
       Terms, the Privacy Policy, and any other documentation, including
       additional terms of service for Premium Services, will govern your
       relationship with LinkedIn.
    3. Notices and Service of Process
       In addition to Section 11.C. (“Notices and Service Messages”), we
       may notify you via postings on Developer Site. You may contact us
       here. Or via mail or courier at: LinkedIn Corporation ATTN: Legal
       Department 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.
       Additionally, LinkedIn accepts service of process at this address.
       Any notices that you provide without compliance with this section
       shall have no legal effect.
    4. Entire Agreement
       You agree that these Terms constitutes the entire, complete and
       exclusive agreement between you and LinkedIn regarding the LinkedIn
       APIs and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
       whether written or oral, or whether established by custom,
       practice, policy or precedent, with respect to the subject matter
       of these Terms. You also may be subject to additional terms and
       conditions that may apply when you use or purchase or use certain
       other LinkedIn services, third-party content or third party
       software.
    5. Amendments to these Terms
       We reserve the right to modify, supplement, or replace the terms of
       these Terms, effective prospectively upon posting on the Developer
       Site or notifying you otherwise. For example, we may present a
       banner on the Developer Site when we have amended these Terms so
       that you may access and review the changes prior to your continued
       use of the LinkedIn APIs and developer platform. If you do not want
       to agree to changes to these Terms, you can terminate these Terms
       at any time by ceasing use of the APIs and/or closing your
       Developer Account.
    6. No informal waivers, agreements or representations
       Our failure to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you
       or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that
       breach or subsequent similar or other breaches. Except as expressly
       and specifically contemplated by these Terms, no representations,
       statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by any
       LinkedIn affiliate shall be deemed legally binding on any LinkedIn
       Affiliate, unless documented in a physical writing hand signed by a
       duly appointed officer of LinkedIn.
    7. No Injunctive Relief
       In no event shall you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive
       or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation
       of the LinkedIn developer platform or any APIs, content or other
       material used or displayed through the LinkedIn developer platform.
    8. Beneficiaries
       Entities other than LinkedIn Corporation and LinkedIn Ireland,
       Limited, that LinkedIn Corporation owns a 50% or greater interest
