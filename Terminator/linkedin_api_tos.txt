LinkedIn APIs Terms of Use

   Oct 22, 2009 — LIDeveloperAdmin
    1. Introduction
         1. Welcome to the LinkedIn Developer Program
            We’re excited that you’ve chosen to develop on the LinkedIn
            platform. At LinkedIn, we believe in putting our members
            first. We created our Developer Program to enable developers
            to create fantastic applications for our members. Together, we
            are building the professional web.
            Our members include professionals and aspiring professionals.
            Participating in our Developer program requires that you act
            professionally as well:
               o To your users
               o To their fellow LinkedIn members
               o To LinkedIn
            These Terms will evolve, so please check back regularly.
         2. Who This Program Is For
            We actively encourage you to create new types of applications
            that could never exist without the LinkedIn platform.
            Please incorporate our APIs into your products to enable
            LinkedIn members to:
               o Bring their professional identities with them as they
                 move across the web
               o Increase their productivity by enriching their
                 experiences with professional information
               o Build their professional brand by publishing, discussing,
                 and sharing content
               o Gain insights into how they can be more successful
                 through content curation and discovery
               o Network, online and offline, with fellow professionals
               o Discover and connect with like minded professionals who
                 can help them in their careers
            The use of our plugins is subject to the terms of our Plugins
            Terms of Use. If you use both APIs and LinkedIn plugins in
            your Application, you must comply with these Terms and the
            Plugins Terms of Use.
         3. Who Our Partner Programs Are For
            We designed our Partner Programs to give specific categories
            of applications access to our Platform. Approved partners in
            these programs often get enhanced use of our APIs and premium
            support.
            Learn more about all of our Partner Programs, including the
            application process, at
            [25]https://developer.linkedin.com/partner-programs.
            If your application falls into one or more of the following
            categories, you are required to be part of one of our Partner
            Programs and have a signed agreement with LinkedIn that allows
            you to use our APIs in your application:
               o Applications used for hiring, marketing, or sales. For
                 example, employee hiring, company marketing or
                 monitoring, lead generation, relationship management,
                 systematic matching of people with their LinkedIn
                 profile, or anything with a similar feature or purpose.
                 Developers interested in these categories often apply to
                 one of the following Partner Programs: Social Media
                 Management, Ads, ATS, Job Postings, CRM, or our Certified
                 Developer Program.
               o Applications that currently have or expect to have more
                 than 250,000 lifetime members using our APIs, make more
                 than 500,000 daily API calls, make more than 500,000
                 lifetime people search API calls, or serve greater than 1
                 million daily plugin impressions.
               o Applications that store or export any data from LinkedIn
                 other than the Profile Data as explicitly allowed in
                 Section III.B. This includes data for anyone other than
                 the member, such as a member’s connections, people found
                 via search, and information about companies and job
                 postings.
            If you believe that you are a good fit for one of these
            programs or are interested in building an application that
            requires access or permission under our Partner Programs,
            please contact us.
    2. Joining our Program
         1. Developer Accounts and Access Credentials
              1. Developer Account.
                 To use the API, you must first sign up for a Developer
                 Account using your real LinkedIn account. Both the
                 Developer Account and your LinkedIn account must contain
                 accurate and up-to-date information at all times,
                 including your current title, company, and e-mail
                 address.
              2. Access Credentials.
                 Once you have a Developer Account you may obtain Access
                 Credentials for your Application. The Access Credentials
                 enable us to associate your API activity with your
                 Application and the members using it. All activities that
                 occur using your Access Credentials are your
                 responsibility. Keep them secret. Do not sell, transfer,
                 or sublicense them. Do not attempt to circumvent the
                 Access Credentials. You must not require your users to
                 obtain their own Access Credentials to use your
                 Application.
              3. Test Accounts.
                 For testing purposes only, you may create up to five
                 LinkedIn accounts. Accounts must be created manually and
                 not via any automated means, including scripts. These
                 test accounts must not interact with non-test accounts
                 (e.g. they must not be used to post messages in Groups),
                 or be used to circumvent user limits. These accounts must
                 have profiles that clearly identify them as test
                 accounts, not have any profile positions at real
                 companies besides your own, and be listed as Developers
                 on your Developer Account.
         2. API License
            Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
            non-assignable, non-transferable license under LinkedIn’s
            intellectual property rights during the term of this agreement
            to use the APIs to develop, test, and support your
            Application, and to let your customers use your integration of
            the APIs within your Application.
    3. Act Professionally
         1. Display and Use Content Properly
              1. Data Views.
                 Each user must grant your application access to their
                 LinkedIn network, and each user may only see data from
                 his or her own LinkedIn network. Data from one user’s
                 LinkedIn account or network must not be exposed to
                 another user. People’s views of their networks are
                 private to them, based on the connections they have. For
                 example, you must not gather information about a LinkedIn
                 member in one user’s network and show that information to
                 other users.
              2. Excluded Uses.
                 The use scenarios below are not permitted under these
                 Terms. You must never do any of the following:
                   1. Use LinkedIn Content in any advertisements or for
                      purposes of targeting advertisements, in your
                      Application or elsewhere.
                   2. Use the Content for any of the following: generating
                      messages, promotions, offers, or mass messages; or
                      for any other purpose other than, and solely to the
                      extent necessary for, allowing end users to use the
                      Content in your Application.
                   3. Use the APIs in any Application that contains or
                      displays adult content, promotes gambling, involves
                      the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under 21
                      years of age, or otherwise violates any law or
                      regulation.
                   4. Sell, lease, share, transfer, or sublicense any
                      Content or access to any Content, directly or
                      indirectly, to any third party, including any
                      recruiter, data broker, salesperson, or
                      advertising-related entity.
                   5. Offer API search results as aggregated search.
                   6. Commingle Content from the APIs with any LinkedIn
                      data obtained directly or indirectly from another
                      source, including data scraped from our Website or
                      data provided by a third party. For example, you
                      cannot supplement the Profile Data you have received
                      via the API with other LinkedIn information obtained
                      from scraping our Website, whether that scraping was
                      done by you or a third party.
                   7. Display Content, including search results, gathered
                      using the Access Credentials of another person. Each
                      person must authenticate individually.
                   8. Distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs,
                      or provide an application program interface that
                      provides access to LinkedIn Content. Anyone who
                      wants access to our APIs and Content must join our
                      Developer Program.
         2. Store Content Only As Allowed
            This Section III(B) replaces the old Section 3.4 that may be
            referred to in some of our other agreements. The terms of this
            Section III(B) apply everywhere that Section 3.4 of the API
            Terms of Use is referenced.
              1. No Copying.
                 Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you must
                 not copy or store any Content. This restriction includes
                 any derived, hashed, or transformed data, or any method
                 where you capture information expressed by the Content,
                 even if you don’t store the Content itself.
              2. Tokens.
                 You may store the alphanumeric user IDs (Member Tokens)
                 that we provide to you for identifying users or any
                 individual member’s authentication token (OAuth Token)
                 that we provide to you when a LinkedIn user authenticates
                 your Application to his LinkedIn account.
              3. Cache for Performance.
                 To improve the member experience, you may cache LinkedIn
                 Content, but you must not do so for more than 24 hours
                 from your original request. This limited permission to
                 cache is for performance reasons only. You do not have
                 any rights to the LinkedIn Content beyond this limited
                 use.
              4. Member Profile Data.
                 If you obtain a member’s consent to store that member’s
                 profile, you may perform a one-time capture of the
                 Profile Data for that member and store that Profile Data.
                 The process for obtaining member consent must meet the
                 specifications provided by LinkedIn and explicitly inform
                 the member which parts of his or her profile you are
                 storing. Each future request for revised Profile Data
                 must be accompanied by another request for consent from
                 that member and consent from that member. You must use
                 stored Profile Data solely for the benefit of the
                 LinkedIn user that granted you permission to access it.
                 You must not monetize it, directly or indirectly. For
                 example, you may not sell access to an aggregated
                 collection of profiles or the most relevant people for a
                 position.
         3. Delete Content When Asked
              1. Delete at User Request
                 You must delete all data collected with the user’s
                 consent, including the Member Token and the OAuth Token,
                 upon request by the user, when the user uninstalls your
                 Application, or when the user closes his or her account
                 with you. The restrictions of this Section III(C)(1) do
                 not apply to data that users provide directly to you and
                 that is separately entered or uploaded to you by the user
                 of your Application.
              2. Delete for Breach.
                 You must immediately delete all data if we terminate your
                 use of the APIs for breach of these Terms, except when
                 doing so would cause you to violate any law or obligation
                 imposed by a governmental authority.
         4. Don’t Harm or Trick Members
            Your Application must include your own user agreement and
            privacy policy. Your user agreement and privacy policy must be
            prominently identified or located where users download or
            access your Application. You must promptly notify us of any
            breaches of your user agreement or privacy policy that impact
            or may impact our members. Your privacy policy must be at
            least as stringent and user-friendly as LinkedIn’s.
            Before obtaining information from your users of the
            Application, you must obtain their informed consent by
            informing them what information you collect and how it will be
            used and/or shared.
            Your Application must not:
               o Implement features or business practices that harm the
                 professional reputation, relationships, or professional
                 ecosystem of LinkedIn members.
               o Impersonate a LinkedIn user or misrepresent any user or
                 other third party when requesting or publishing
                 information.
               o Obfuscate or hide any LinkedIn buttons, sign-in
                 functionality, consent, or authorization flows from your
                 users. In order to access member specific Content through
                 the APIs, your users must sign-in with their LinkedIn
                 credentials and grant your Application access to their
                 Content.
               o Proxy, request or collect LinkedIn user names or
                 passwords. You are never allowed to collect or use a
                 LinkedIn member’s username or password in any fashion for
                 any reason. We want our members to have safe and
                 consistent experiences across all applications.
         5. Be a Good Citizen to our Platform
            You share LinkedIn and our APIs with your fellow members and
            developers. Write your Application as you’d want others to
            write theirs.
               o Only ask for the minimum data fields your application
                 needs to work properly.
               o Don’t try to exceed or circumvent your limitations on
                 calls and use. This includes creating multiple
                 applications for identical, or largely similar, usage
                 (e.g. having one application per customer). If we believe
                 that you have exceeded or circumvented our limitations,
                 or if you have tried to, we may temporarily suspend or
                 permanently block your access to the APIs, disable your
                 developer account, or both.
               o Don’t download, scrape, post, or transmit, in any form or
                 by any means, any part of our Website or Content.
               o Don’t copy, reformat, reverse-engineer, or otherwise
                 modify the APIs, Access Credentials, our Website or any
                 Content.
               o Don’t interfere with or disrupt LinkedIn services or
                 servers or networks connected to LinkedIn services, or
                 disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or
                 regulations of networks connected to LinkedIn services.
         6. Treat Our Brand With Respect
              1. Brand Features License.
                 Subject to these Terms, including the Branding
                 Guidelines, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
                 non-assignable, non-sublicenseable, and non-transferable
                 license during the Term to display our Brand Features to
                 promote or advertise your integration of the APIs in your
                 Application.
              2. Restrictions.
                 You must not:
                   1. Display our Brand Features in any way that is
                      misleading, defamatory, infringing, libelous,
                      disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable to
                      LinkedIn in its sole discretion, or in a way that
                      suggests we have created, sponsored, or endorsed
                      your Application or its content;
                   2. Remove any legal, copyright, trademark, watermark or
                      other proprietary rights notices contained in or on
                      materials you receive or access pursuant to these
                      Terms, including the APIs, the materials posted at
                      the Developer Site, and our Website; or
                   3. Use the APIs or Brand Features for any illegal,
                      unauthorized or otherwise improper purposes, or in
                      any manner that would violate these Terms (or any
                      document incorporated into the Terms), or breach any
                      laws or regulations, or violate any rights of third
                      parties, or expose LinkedIn or its members to legal
                      liability in your use of the APIs.
              3. Publicity by You.
                 Subject to our Branding Guidelines, You may promote your
                 Application, including talking to traditional and online
                 media and your users about your Application, so long as
                 you do so truthfully and without implying that your
                 Application is created or endorsed by LinkedIn (or
                 otherwise embellishing your relationship with LinkedIn).
                 However, you may not issue any formal press release via
                 traditional or online media referring to LinkedIn without
                 LinkedIn’s prior consent, unless expressly allowed in the
                 Branding Guidelines.
              4. Publicity by Us.
                 We may publicly refer to you, orally or in writing, as a
                 licensee of the LinkedIn APIs. We may also publish your
                 name and logo (with or without a link to your
                 Application) on our Website, in press releases, and in
                 promotional materials without your prior consent.
         7. Follow The Law and These Terms
            You must comply with all applicable laws, including, the
            Digital Millennium Copyright Act and applicable export laws,
            and these Terms, which may be amended from time to time with
            or without advance notice, in order to use the LinkedIn APIs.
            You and your Application must also comply with the following,
            which are hereby incorporated by reference:
              1. [26]The LinkedIn User Agreement
              2. [27]The LinkedIn Privacy Policy
              3. [28]The Platform Guidelines, which are located at the
                 Developer Site and
              4. [29]The Branding Guidelines
            In the event of any conflict between the content in this
            document and the above documents, this document controls your
            use of the APIs. If you disagree with any of the provisions in
            these Terms, do not click that you agree to them, and do not
            access or use the APIs.
            The most current version of these Terms can be reviewed on the
            Developer Site. By using the LinkedIn APIs after changes are
            made to the Terms, you agree to be bound by the most current
            version. If you disagree with the Terms, or changes to the
            Terms, you must discontinue your use of the APIs.
            If we have entered into a separate, written API License
            Agreement with you, the terms of that agreement will govern
            your use of those APIs.
    4. Safety and Abuse
         1. Security Measures
            Your network, operating system and the software of your web
            servers, databases, and computer systems (collectively,
            “Systems”) must be properly configured to securely operate
            your Application. You must not architect or select Systems in
            a manner to avoid the foregoing obligation. You must promptly
            report any security deficiencies in or intrusions to your
            Systems that you discover to LinkedIn in writing via email to
            support@linkedin.com or subsequent contact information posted
            in the Developer Site. You will work with LinkedIn to
            immediately correct any security deficiency, and will
            disconnect immediately any intrusions or intruder. In the
            event of any security deficiency or intrusion involving the
            Application, you will make no public statements (i.e. press,
            blogs, bulletin boards, etc.) without prior written and
            express permission from LinkedIn in each instance.
         2. Monitoring
            You agree to assist LinkedIn in verifying your compliance with
            these Terms by providing information about your Application to
            us, which may also include access to your Application and
            other materials related to your use of the APIs. If you do not
            demonstrate full compliance with this Agreement, we may
            restrict or terminate your access to the APIs.
    5. Other Legal Terms
         1. Rights we reserve.
              1. Support and Modifications.
                 We may provide you with support or modifications for the
                 APIs in our sole discretion. We may stop providing
                 support or modifications to you at any time without
                 notice or liability to you. We may release subsequent
                 versions of the APIs and require that you use those
                 subsequent versions. Your continued use of the APIs
                 following a subsequent release will be deemed your
                 acceptance of modifications.
              2. Fees.
                 The APIs are currently provided for free, but LinkedIn
                 reserves the right to charge for the APIs in the future.
                 If we do charge a fee for use of the APIs or any
                 developer tools and features, you do not have any
                 obligation to continue to use LinkedIn’s developer
                 resources.
              3. LinkedIn Independent Development.
                 You understand and acknowledge that LinkedIn may be
                 independently creating applications, content, and other
                 products or services that may be similar to or
                 competitive with your Application. Nothing in these Terms
                 will be construed as restricting or preventing LinkedIn
                 from creating and fully exploiting any applications,
                 content, and other items, without any obligation to you.
              4. Developer Exception to our Privacy Policy.
                 LinkedIn may reveal personal information about developers
                 for attribution purposes, handling inquiries from users
                 or potential users, and other purposes LinkedIn
                 reasonably deems necessary under these Terms. You
                 understand and agree that LinkedIn may access, preserve,
                 and disclose your personal information and your developer
                 account details if required to do so by law or in a good
                 faith belief that such access, preservation, or
                 disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal
                 process or to protect the rights, property, or safety of
                 LinkedIn, its affiliates or partners, its users, or the
                 general public.
         2. Proprietary Rights.
              1. LinkedIn Property.
                 As between you and us, we own all rights, title, and
                 interest, including all intellectual property rights, in
                 and to, the (a) APIs, and all elements, components, and
                 executables of the APIs; (b) the Content available from
                 the APIs; (c) our Website; and (d) our Brand Features
                 (clauses (a)-(d) collectively, the “LinkedIn Materials”).
                 Except for the express licenses granted in these Terms,
                 LinkedIn does not grant you any right, title, or interest
                 in the LinkedIn Materials. You agree to take such
                 actions, including executing affidavits or other
                 documents, as LinkedIn may reasonably request to effect,
                 perfect, or confirm LinkedIn’s rights to the LinkedIn
                 Materials.
              2. Feedback.
                 You have no obligation to give us any suggestions,
                 comments or other feedback (“Feedback”) relating to the
                 LinkedIn Materials. However, we may use and include any
                 Feedback that you voluntarily provide to improve the
                 LinkedIn Materials and/or any other of our products,
                 services, or technologies. Accordingly, if you give
                 Feedback, you agree that we may freely use, reproduce,
                 license, and distribute such Feedback. You also agree not
                 to provide Feedback that you know is subject to any
                 intellectual property claim by a third party or any
                 license terms that would require products or services
                 derived from that Feedback to be licensed to or from, or
                 shared with, any third party.
              3. Application.
                 You represent and warrant to LinkedIn that, excluding
                 LinkedIn Materials, you have the right to use, reproduce,
                 transmit, copy, publicly display, publicly perform, and
                 distribute your Application, and that use by LinkedIn and
                 its users of your Application will not violate the rights
                 of any third party (e.g., copyright, patent, trademark,
                 or other proprietary right of any person or entity), or
                 any applicable regulation or law, including the laws of
                 any country in which your Application is made available.
                 Except to the extent your Application contains LinkedIn
                 Materials, LinkedIn claims no ownership or control over
                 your Application. During the term of these Terms you
                 hereby grant to us a paid-up, royalty-free,
                 non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable right and license,
                 under all of your intellectual property rights, to: (a)
                 use, perform, and display your Application and its
                 content for purposes of marketing, demonstrating, and
                 making your Application available to users; (b) link to
                 and direct users to your Application; and (c) sublicense
                 the foregoing rights to our affiliates. Following the
                 termination of these Terms and upon written request from
                 you, LinkedIn will make commercially reasonable efforts,
                 as determined in its sole discretion, to remove all
                 references and links to your Application from the
                 LinkedIn Website and service. LinkedIn has no other
                 obligation to delete copies of, references to, or links
                 to your Application.
         3. Term and Termination.
              1. Term.
                 The term of this agreement will commence on the date upon
                 which you agree to these Terms and will continue until:
                 you discontinue using our APIs, you close your Developer
                 Account, or we terminate your access to the APIs, this
                 agreement, or both.
              2. Suspension; Termination.
                 We may suspend or terminate your use of all or any of the
                 APIs at any time if we believe you have violated these
                 Terms or, if we believe the availability of the APIs in
                 your Application is not in our or our members’ best
                 interests. We may discontinue the availability of some or
                 all of the APIs at any time for any reason. We may also
                 impose limits on certain features and services or
                 restrict your access to some or all of the APIs or our
                 Website. All of our rights in these Terms may be
                 exercised without prior notice or liability to you.
              3. Effect of Termination
                 Upon termination of the agreement between you and us
                 under these Terms:
                   1. all rights and licenses granted to you will
                      terminate immediately;
                   2. you will promptly destroy LinkedIn Confidential
                      Information in your possession or control;
                   3. neither party is liable to the other party just
                      because the agreement has been terminated; and
                   4. unless we agree otherwise in writing or as stated in
                      these Terms, you must permanently delete all Content
                      or other data which you stored pursuant to your use
                      of the APIs. LinkedIn may request that you certify
                      in writing your compliance with this section.
              4. Survival.
                 Sections III(A)(2), III(B), III(C), III(D), III(E),
                 III(F)(2), and the following sub-sections in Section V
                 will survive any termination of this agreement: A.3, A.4,
                 B, C.4, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.
         4. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.
            While LinkedIn strives to have its APIs available
            continuously, we cannot guarantee any up-time for any LinkedIn
            developer resource, including the APIs.
            THE LINKEDIN MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITH NO WARRANTY,
            EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY
            AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
            WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, TITLE, AND
            NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME OF THE LINKEDIN MATERIALS ARE
            EXPERIMENTAL AND HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED IN ANY MANNER. WE DO NOT
            REPRESENT, WARRANT OR MAKE ANY CONDITION THAT THE LINKEDIN
            MATERIALS ARE FREE OF INACCURACIES, ERRORS, BUGS, OR
            INTERRUPTIONS, OR ARE RELIABLE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR
            OTHERWISE VALID. YOUR USE OF THE LINKEDIN MATERIALS IS AT YOUR
            OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
            FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT RESULTS FROM USE OF THE LINKEDIN MATERIALS
            INCLUDING FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF
            DATA. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN,
            OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US OR THROUGH OR FROM OUR WEBSITE OR OUR
            SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY
            STATED IN THESE TERMS.
         5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
            YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO THE
            EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND
            AND AGREE THAT LINKEDIN WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY
            DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
            EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
            GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF
            LINKEDIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES),
            RESULTING FROM: (1) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE
            LINKEDIN MATERIALS; (2) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
            GOODS AND SERVICES; (3) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION
            OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (4) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF
            ANY THIRD PARTY ON OR IN THE LINKEDIN MATERIALS OR ANY
            LINKEDIN SERVICES; OR (5) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE
            LINKEDIN MATERIALS OR ANY LINKEDIN SERVICES. UNDER NO
            CIRCUMSTANCES WILL LINKEDIN’S AGGREGATE, CUMULATIVE LIABILITY
            TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, UNDER
            ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED U.S. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S.
            $100).
         6. INDEMNIFICATION
            You agree to hold harmless and indemnify LinkedIn, and its
            affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, agents,
            employees, advertisers, and partners, from and against any
            third party claim arising from or in any way related to your
            use of any LinkedIn Materials, violation of these Terms, or
            any other actions connected with your use of the APIs,
            including any liability or expense arising from all claims,
            losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments,
            litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, of every kind
            and nature.
         7. GOVERNING LAW
            These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance
            with the laws of the State of California as such laws apply to
            contracts between California residents performed entirely
            within California. Any action or proceeding arising out of or
            relating to these Terms or your use of the APIs must be
            brought in a federal court in the Northern District of
            California or in state court in Santa Clara County, California
            and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and
            venue of any such court. In the event of litigation between
            the parties arising out of or related to these Terms or your
            use of the APIs, the prevailing party will be entitled to
            recover its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred.
         8. REMEDIES
            You acknowledge that your breach of these Terms may cause
            irreparable harm to LinkedIn, the extent of which would be
            difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, you agree that, in
            addition to any other remedies to which LinkedIn may be
            legally entitled, LinkedIn will have the right to seek
            immediate injunctive relief in the event of a breach of these
            Terms by you or any of your officers, employees, consultants,
            or other agents.
         9. MISCELLANEOUS
            The failure of LinkedIn to exercise or enforce any right or
            provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such
            right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found
            by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the
            parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to
            the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the
            other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and
            effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
            LinkedIn and you with respect to the subject matter in this
            document, and they supersede any and all prior proposals (oral
            and written), understandings, representations and other
            communications between you and us. Nothing in these Terms will
            be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture of any
            kind between the parties and neither party will have the
            authority or power to bind the other party or to contract in
            the name of or create a liability against the other party in
            any way or for any purpose. You may not assign these Terms, in
            whole or in part, without LinkedIn’s prior written consent.
            Any assignment in violation of this section is null and void.
            The section headings in these Terms are for convenience only
            and have no legal or contractual effect.
